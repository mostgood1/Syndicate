# Syndicate — Work Lanes

> Lanes are exclusive by file path. Two lanes may not claim the same file.
> Max concurrent OPEN lanes: 3 (see `state.md`).
> Managed by `/lane`. Do not hand-edit while a session is running.

> **History lives in `lanes_history.md`.** This file is read at the start of
> every session, so it carries each lane's CURRENT state plus one prior block --
> **plus any block that declares file claims**, which `lane-guard` reads from
> here and nowhere else. 36 superseded blocks (2,667 lines) were moved out
> verbatim on 2026-08-18. Nothing was summarised or deleted: if a lane's earlier
> reasoning matters, it is there under the same slug.

#### ORPHAN SWEEP 2026-08-18 ~21:4xZ — 8 lanes RELEASED, 32 claims dropped, contested-file invariant CLEARED

**Measured with `lane-guard.py`'s OWN `_claims()`**, not the simplified copy in
`check_lane_invariants.py` — the two disagree, and the difference decides
outcomes. The checker lacks the guard's `_is_disclaimer` / `_claimable_prefix`
handling, so it reported 70 claims / 12 OPEN lanes where the guard actually saw
**102 claims / 17 OPEN lanes**. Read the guard when the question is "is this
file guarded"; the checker answers a different, looser question.

    claims         102 -> 70          OPEN lanes holding claims  17 -> 9
    contested       1  -> 0           (live_gameline_join.py)
    OPEN-under-Archived  15 -> 7

**RELEASED (owner session archived or role retired, verified against the full
roster INCLUDING archived — `include_archived: false` hides exactly the
evidence this question needs):**

| lane | owning session | why released |
|---|---|---|
| `syndicate-coordinator` | `syndicate-coordinator` | role RETIRED by user decision; all 3 "Deploy and Document Coordinator" sessions archived |
| `clv-without-settlement` | `lane-cleanup` | = "Orphaned lanes cleanup", archived 08-16 01:14 |
| `layer2-board-quality` | `layer2-board-quality` | all 3 "Layer 2 board audit" sessions archived; the block itself said claims "can be released on request" |
| `wnba-live-tier` | `layer1-board-coverage` | all 6 "Layer 1 board coverage audit" forks archived — **this is what cleared the contested file** |
| `wnba-phase2-migration` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `modelled-fair-edge` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `odds-cadence-off-the-mlb-peak` | `sim-engine-track` | all 5 "Sim engine scheduling assessment" forks archived |
| `convergence-phase5-profile-seam` | `sim-scheduling` | same family, all archived |

**NOT RELEASED, DELIBERATELY — a live or plausibly-live owner exists.** Releasing
these would un-guard files a running session is editing, which is the exact
failure the lane system exists to prevent:

    basketball-model-owner    "Basketball model deep dive"   RUNNING
    nhl-model-owner           "NHL hockey model deep dive"   RUNNING
    soccer-model-dispersion   "Soccer Session (fork)"        RUNNING
    convergence-phase7-crps   "Modeling Session (fork 2)"    active today 21:40Z
    grading-blocker-settled-zero  "Betting settlement data"  RUNNING — plausible owner by SUBJECT, not by name; the header names `alt-line-shortlist-watch`. UNRESOLVED, left guarded.
    refresh-worker-oom-recurrence "Oom band full report"     flagged running (stale 40h)
    live-edge-basis           `ask-answer-substance`         no roster match; left guarded because it now SOLELY owns `live_gameline_join.py`
    repo-coordination         unmapped                       holds the global `.current-lane`; 9 claims
    ask-sport-coverage        `ask-sport-coverage`           owner family archived, but it sits correctly under `## OPEN` and is the digest's lead lane — flagged, not swept

**THE 7 REMAINING `OPEN`-UNDER-`## Archived lanes` ARE NOT MINE TO FIX.** Every
one belongs to a live or uncertain lane above, and the remedy is to MOVE the
block above the `## Archived lanes` marker — which is editing another lane's
block. Left for each owner. The hazard is real but latent: their claims work
today and would be dropped silently by a future archive pass.

**Method note for the next sweep.** `.syndicate/.current-lane.<uuid>` marker
filenames match archived `sessionId`s exactly (6 of 13 did), so a marker whose
id resolves to an ARCHIVED session is hard evidence the lane is orphaned. The
markers for running sessions did NOT match any roster id, so the mapping proves
death, never life — do not invert it.

### open-bet-live-status — OPEN, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — opened 2026-08-26 — session syndicate-27 (749848)

  `venue-refresh-decoupling` `[2026-08-28, session 3e5a9659]`** — an additive
  timing span around `join_polymarket_to_board`, NO behaviour change. Taken
  because this lane's session (`syndicate-27`) is NOT RUNNING (`list_sessions`
  shows every session `isRunning: false`) and the board build cannot attribute
  ~305s of CPU without it. **The SEMANTIC scope of this file stays yours** —
  side resolution, alias matching, the join's correctness. Take it back by

  SEMANTIC scope; the instrumentation-only transfer struck above stands).
  A marker governs ONLY ITS OWN LINE -- `_claimable_prefix` cuts at the first
  marker and keeps everything before it, so a path that WRAPS onto an unmarked
  continuation line is claimed in full. That is why each path above repeats the
  word rather than sharing one lead-in. All three are now
  held in full by `venue-join-refusal-visibility`, which is fixing the
  Polymarket soccer league-bucketing gap and the ops slate reader that
  disagrees with the join about it. Taken because this lane's session is
  ARCHIVED and not running -- verified in that session, not assumed:
  `list_sessions(include_archived=true)` shows `local_f08f0df5` "Portfolio
  page consolidation", `isArchived: true`, `isRunning: false`, last activity

### convergence-phase7-crps — OPEN, **UNOWNED** `[session abf487e4 ARCHIVED 2026-08-20T21:1xZ]` — **FIVE FINDINGS: FOUR DEFECTS FIXED AND MEASURED, ONE NOT A DEFECT.** Ladder over the 12MB publish ceiling (pitcher strikeouts 0/12 → 18/18 rows with market lines, verified on the served payload); conditional mix never CALLED from the roster build; season-artifact pull matching NOTHING (bare globs vs fnmatch on full paths) — all five inputs now present on the worker. NOT a defect: `vs_pitcher_*` is unfed by `FORWARD_BVP_MATCHUP_MODE=off`, a modelling decision; reclassified as `disabled` so nfail means "wrong". **THE ONE THING OWED: verify on 2026-08-21** — first `sim_input_report_2026-08-21.json` via `/api/ops/artifacts/export?pattern=*sim_input_report*` must show `nfail` **10 → 0**; still 10 on a fresh `generated_at` means the wiring is INERT and this reopens. Claims: NONE held. Still open, deliberately not fixed: ephemeral `vendor/*/data/` statcast caches; BVP left OFF by design. — opened 2026-08-17

### wnba-live-odds-capture-gap — OPEN, NARROWED, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — **THE AUTORUN FIRED FOR REAL `[2026-08-21T00:07:24.782Z / 19:07 CT]`, observed by a third party (scheduled task `verify-wnba-live-scale-481`, session `1f76348c`) on IND@DAL. The "never fired" blocker is DISCHARGED. What replaces it: the autorun launches every ~4.3 min and refreshes the LIVE-LENS path, but `book_quotes/<date>.jsonl` advanced ONCE (00:07:49Z) and was still byte-identical 26 min later. The lane's literal testable outcome PASSES, but passing cannot be attributed to the autorun — see FINDINGS.** **ROOT CAUSE FOUND `[00:45Z]`: the autorun is fine; `refresh_wnba_oddsapi_props.py`'s REUSE GUARD sits upstream of it and returns `reused_artifact_bundle` every tick, so the child that appends `book_quotes` never spawns. The guard's staleness bound is the PREGAME sweep interval (2h) and its reuse key carries no phase term, so a 240s live autorun cannot outrun it. THE FIX BELONGS IN THE GUARD, NOT THE AUTORUN.** — opened 2026-08-20 — session 2bffd747-efb5-45d8-b4f3-ae067b645eb7

### soccer-board-mlb-parity — OPEN, UNOWNED (session `f98be73b` checkpointed 2026-08-22 23:2xZ) — **TWO THINGS DEPLOYED TONIGHT. (1) `#518` FOTMOB MOMENTUM — live-odds-worker `94a16efe`, live 22:18:35Z: the event-signal sweep (momentum/xG/shot pressure) was killed by a null control, but a pooled 60-120s model IS real and DIRECTIONAL (which team scores next, dAUC +0.071), driven by FotMob's own momentum series; production's ESPN proxy carries NO signal at any half-life — retired. 5,552-match dataset committed. (2) COMPACT CARD REDESIGN — web `a1dc1e9a`, live 23:08:55Z, VERIFIED ON PRODUCTION HTML: pregame cards show sim-projected totals + BTTS/goals/corners/top-score; final cards RECONCILE those same facts against the real result (19 hit/62 miss on today's slate, spot-checked by hand).** OWED: (a) the FotMob join has never resolved a real fixture — MLS kickoff 2026-08-23T01:30Z is the first test; (b) the live-odds market-pricing pilot sits at 1.46 SE, n=106, needs ~2 more match-days.

  **the soccer cards builder was REMOVED FROM THE BRACE ABOVE
  `[2026-08-28, session 3e5a9659]`** —
  claim transferred to `soccer-overview-cost` for INSTRUMENTATION ONLY (two
  sub-marks inside `_build_cards_page_context_uncached`, no behaviour change,
  released: nothing near the FotMob/live-lens work this lane owns). Taken because this
  lane is UNOWNED — session `f98be73b` checkpointed 2026-08-22 and does not
  appear in `list_sessions` at all. REMOVED rather than struck through, and
  removed from INSIDE the brace: `check_lane_invariants` parses paths
  positionally and a brace expansion is a claim per member. To reclaim, put
  that filename back inside the brace.
  **AND THE FILENAME ITSELF HAD TO GO, not just its position in the brace**
  `[2026-08-29, session 6dc988f8, lane ncaaf-live-lens-state]` — this note
  said the claim was removed while still spelling the bare filename twice
  inside the `- Files:` block, so `_claims()` kept yielding it. `lane-guard`
  released: matches on path SUFFIX (`rel.endswith("/" + f)`, line 420), and a bare
  filename has no directory to disambiguate it, so this UNOWNED soccer lane
  was claiming **every sport's cards builder** — mlb, nba, nfl, ncaaf, wnba.
  It blocked an NCAAF edit on 2026-08-29 while the first game of the season
  was in progress. `check_lane_invariants` did NOT catch it: it checks that
  each claim has exactly one holder, and this claim did. Same basename
  released: collision `state.md` records for `live_lens` across eight sports. **A
  disclaimer next to a path does not unclaim it — only deleting the path
  text does.**

Unit-verified both directions: 3 break tests FAIL pre-fix, 2 narrowness tests PASS in both states. **THE BREAK BEHAVIOUR ITSELF IS UNOBSERVED IN PRODUCTION** — a 20-minute watcher caught no blank-clock state, and the one suggestive reading (a board row at 'End of 1st' keeping a live lane at model 0.2155 vs its 0.27 pregame baseline) was INDIRECT, via the board.

(a) `#499` PASSES only if totals rows refuse as `prob_interval_swamps_edge` (per-row) NOT `analytic_estimator_never_backtested_for_this_market` (category-wide); at sigma=0.150 the bar is ~30pp so **priceable volume is a BUG signal, not success**. (b) `#498` props PASSES only on `WNBA_LIVE_BOX_CAPTURED` with players (live-odds-worker) AND `live_projections.rows_live_projected` > 0.

- Files: released: `tests/test_home_wnba_live_state.py`
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
released: - **`syndicate/blueprints/home.py` IS NOT LISTED ABOVE ON PURPOSE `[2026-08-28,
  session 3e5a9659]`.** Its claim moved to `soccer-overview-cost` for
  INSTRUMENTATION ONLY — per-league timing inside the soccer games loop, no
  released: behaviour change, nothing near the WNBA chip/live-token work this lane owns.
  Taken because this lane is marked UNOWNED (session 3dcd0fb2 checkpointed and
  ARCHIVED 2026-08-27). To reclaim, put the path back on the `- Files:` line.
  **THE PATH IS REMOVED RATHER THAN STRUCK THROUGH** because
  released: `check_lane_invariants.py` parses paths POSITIONALLY and a `~~struck~~` path
  released: is still a live claim — that is a standing rule in `learnings.md` and I broke
  it here first, producing a false contest between two OPEN lanes.
  — RELEASED (see the note below) — `game_chip_scoreboard.py` was ADDED here
  after the first test run, because refusing to SET a fractional score in
  released: `home.py` was not enough: `_side_score` falls through to
  `live_state.<side>_pts` and picks the projection back up.
  — **RELEASED: `syndicate/features/shared/game_chip_scoreboard.py` IS NO
  LONGER LISTED ABOVE, ON PURPOSE `[2026-08-28, session 28195565, user
  authorised]`.** Its claim moved to `mlb-final-zero-placeholder` for the
  0-0 placeholder branch
  inside `build_game_chip` ONLY — the code that runs AFTER `_side_score`
  returns. **`_side_score` and its `live_state.<side>_pts` fallthrough — this
  lane's actual subject — are UNTOUCHED, as is everything WNBA.** Taken because
  this lane is UNOWNED (session 3dcd0fb2 ARCHIVED 2026-08-27) and an MLB
  scoring defect traced to that branch: a 0-0 schedule placeholder on a game
  whose status had advanced to FINAL was passed through as an observed result.
  **THE PATH IS REMOVED RATHER THAN STRUCK THROUGH**, for the same reason the
  released: `home.py` note above gives — a `~~struck~~` path is still a live claim to
  released: both `lane-guard.py` and `check_lane_invariants.py`, which read positionally.
  (Confirmed here: the guard's disclaimer vocabulary is a fixed list —
  `not claimed`, `released`, `held by`, `claimed by`, … — and "TRANSFERRED" is
  not in it, so a prose transfer note alone releases nothing.)
  **CONSEQUENCE, stated plainly: the guard now protects this file for NEITHER
  lane.** There is no way to express a per-branch claim to it. To reclaim, put
  the path back on the `- Files:` line.
- Blocked by: none. `wnba/cards.py` is claimed by `wnba-halftime-elapsed`.

- Files: **NOT CLAIMED** — this lane is FINDING ONLY and changed nothing. The
  marker is moved to the FRONT of this line `[2026-08-31, lane
  soccer-shot-shrinkage]` so the PARSER agrees with what the lane already said:
  `_claimable_prefix` cuts at the first marker and keeps everything BEFORE it, so
  with the paths written first they were still being enforced as live claims, and
  the two paths it named read as contested against a lane that explicitly
  disclaims them. Nothing is taken from this lane. The paths are deliberately
  NOT repeated here: any path-like token inside a Files block becomes a CLAIM,
  which is the same trap, and writing them again would recreate it.

NO DEPLOY OCCURRED; PRODUCTION NEVER RAN THE AUTORUN.** Lane `prop-join-yield` (session `3492626c`) set `ACCURACY_SUMMARY_ENABLE_REFRESH_WORKER_AUTORUN=true` and messaged rather than deployed — the right call, and their ANALYSIS WAS CORRECT: `#626`(h) and this block were both still gated on the 09-02 OOM, which the projection had already repaired. I re-verified the live commit `4ead66c3` BY CONTENT: `_project_evaluation_record` x4, `_accuracy_summary_ledger_budget_bytes` x2, `DEFAULT_ACCURACY_SUMMARY_LEDGER_BUDGET_BYTES = 2_000_000_000` x1. **The OOM-causing code has not been deployed since 09-02.** I reverted the key anyway, and NOT because of their reasoning: **"inert until a deploy" is true of the process and false of the risk.** The gate (`run_refresh_worker.py:2153`) blocks only while `now_central.hour < 7`, and the other term (`last_run_date 2026-09-02 < today`) was already satisfied — so at 22:4x CT the key fires on the FIRST TICK AFTER ANY DEPLOY, and refresh-worker had taken FIVE deploys in the preceding four hours. Arming at 03:00 CT is safe for one reason only: the gate then holds the run until 07:00 on a quiet worker. Key read back `false`. **Still ARMED as scheduled tasks; nothing about the plan changed.**
- **THE BASH TOOL'S CLOCK IS 5 HOURS SLOW IN THIS REPO — do not date anything from it.** Python and Render's HTTP `Date` header agree to the second against it. This surfaced only because the deploys API returned a deploy that had already FINISHED five hours in my future. Every gate in this system is on CENTRAL HOUR, so a 5-hour error moves you across `hour >= 7`. Full entry in `learnings.md`.
- **WHY THIS LANE WAS DECLARED DEAD TWICE, AND THE TEST THAT CAUSED IT.** Two peers independently concluded this session was gone and acted: `order-model-view` RELEASED its ledger claims at ~20:0xZ, and the same session force-acquired the refresh-worker deploy claim off `fleet-catchup-round3` (`cfcce46d`) at ~20:4xZ. **Both rested on "absent from `list_sessions` including archived", which is not evidence:** lane blocks carry `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`s, `list_sessions` returns CCD `sessionId`s, and the two ID SPACES DO NOT MATCH. Proven here — `send_message` to `local_b2b5b45b-...` returns "Session not found" for a session that was demonstrably committing at the time. My own contribution to the confusion was real: I announced the session was closing and then kept working, so their read was reasonable on the evidence they had. **The forced deploy claim caused no loss** — `a6f5f586` was cancelled at 20:44:34Z, the same second `150cc95b` was created, but `a6f5f586` IS AN ANCESTOR of `150cc95b`, so the `#632` subprocess cap shipped anyway. That is the on-`main` rule working, not luck: cumulative deploys are what being on `main` buys. Full rule in `learnings.md`.
### order-model-view — OPEN — opened 2026-09-03 — session 3492626c — **LIVE ON BOTH ORDER SERVICES (`04187cdf`); VERIFY STILL OWED after 100 min of polling produced ZERO orders written past 19:54:36Z — a null result about the board's PLACEMENT RATE, not evidence about the change.

  **RETURNED IN FULL 2026-09-04 00:0xZ by lane `order-sim-view` on closing.**
  That lane borrowed the first two on 2026-09-03 ~22:0xZ, shipped its change,
  and hands them back unchanged in claim terms.

### prop-join-yield — OPEN — opened 2026-09-03 — session 3492626c — **SESSION ENDED 2026-09-04 02:2xZ. ELEVEN COMMITS, ALL DEPLOYED. Order attribution COMPLETE on both order services (`ab42b221`, 4.5-min ambiguous window) — and the dataset is EMPTY: no order since 15:27:33Z because both venue plans size ZERO. NEXT SESSION: the binding constraint is the BUY FUNNEL, not the instrument.** NCAAF LIVE LANES FIXED AND VERIFIED (`9d106d11`, web `3ecc5d9f`): (live,pregame) 184 -> 0, (live,live) 0 -> 236; MLB 104 -> 1,272. `_refresh_layer2_live_state` runs on WEB, not a worker. BUY FUNNEL DIAGNOSED: kalshi/polymarket size 0 positions, every row refused by market_family_excluded or no_model_edge_pct, NCAAF structurally unbuyable. OVERTURNED: `_SCORE_SIM_WEIGHT` is 0.125 not 0.0 -- two comments are wrong and `side_picked_by`'s reasoning rests on them.** SESSION CLOSED 2026-09-04 00:3xZ. EIGHT COMMITS LIVE, FIVE VERIFIED ON PRODUCTION: MLB prop cause split (13.4% name misses), soccer joined ONCE (6.9x, 19.0%->57.0%), `sim_view: unpriced` (3,306), NCAAF chips 4->11, NCAAF cadence 12,948s->640s (20x, spread 506s = a real loop). OWED: `04187cdf`'s order-record hop (zero orders in 4.5h) and `d5c1c0fa` (blocked until 2026-09-17) — both filed as `#645`.** THREE CHANGES VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION: MLB prop cause split (191/1423 name misses, 13.4%), soccer joined ONCE (`ac735931` — 6.9x inflation removed, coverage 19.0% -> 57.0%, unmatched_match 67.4% -> 0.6%), and `sim_view: unpriced` (`36161e83` — 3,306 rows). NCAAF pregame cadence `a9247011` shipped + enabled, reading OWED.** GOAL MET AND MEASURED ON PRODUCTION. `c5e78549` live on refresh-worker + web; artifact 20:48:16Z reads `player_unmatched_name 191` of `player_rows_considered 1423` = 13.4%, `player_no_projection 43`, accounting closes to 0. 82% of unprojected MLB player rows are a NAME MISS, not an honest blank. OWED: soccer's windowed counts are inflated (`ac735931` NOT deployed).**

### web-oom-profiler-steady — CLOSED 2026-09-04 — opened 2026-09-03 — **`#632` ANSWERED AND VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION AT EVERY STEP.** Excursion: merge children are it (corr +0.997), capped and made cheaper — largest child **281.8 -> 128.1 MB**, peak summed 400.6 -> 163.3 MB, merge output byte-identical. Instrument: attribution moved to THIS PROCESS, which retired `publish` as a false culprit (211 MB container-scoped vs **1.15 MB** per-process) and named `/api/intelligence/query` (~82 MB/call). Payload: **~74% smaller** (self-mirror 50.0% + opt-in alias slimming 47.9%, same-slate live A/B). Rate: **+503 -> +173 MB/h** (R^2 0.90, n=81), moving time-to-limit 2.0 h -> 5.7 h — past the 2.45-3.13 h uptimes at which this service was being OOM-killed. **STILL OPEN, one item:** the exact attributed SHARE, blocked because `app.py` runs background loops IN-PROCESS and `inflight` guarantees no other REQUEST, not no other THREAD — so the route RANKING is trustworthy and the share is not.**

  **NOT claimed, listed for the record:** this lane also writes the
  ledger files under .syndicate (lanes, state, deploys, log). They are EXEMPT
  from lane-guard -- every session writes them -- so naming them as claims
  guards nothing, and naming them as PATHS makes them read as CONTESTED

The tag's RULE is fine; its INPUT is null on 100% of NCAAF rows. Two further defects found on the same served payload, both of which make the board state a number it does not have.**
- **NOTICE from `web-oom-profiler-steady` `[2026-09-04]`: I TOOK THE CLAIM ON `syndicate/templates/intelligence.html`.** `#632` needed the alias-rebuild helper and

  Render ENV on **live-odds-worker** via the single-key API only. The Render
  blueprint file is deliberately NOT named as a path here and is NOT claimed —
  `lane-guard` reads any backticked path inside a `- Files:` block as a CLAIM,
  and spelling it even to forbid it made this lane contest it with
  `accuracy-autorun-rearm` (caught by `check_lane_invariants.py`). See the ENV
  bullet below for why that file must not be pushed for this change.
  Render ENV on **live-odds-worker** via the single-key API — **never `render.yaml`**
  (pushing it fires `blueprint_sync`, which rewrites every key on all three
  services).
  Collision-checked 2026-09-03 against every OPEN lane: no OPEN lane claims any
  of these. `run_live_odds_refresh_worker.py` is `released:` in
  `open-bet-live-status` and explicitly "Not claimed, read-only reference" in
  `wnba-live-odds-capture-gap`; `refresh_odds_sources.py` is claimed only by
  the ARCHIVED `soccer-odds-coverage`, whose claims were released 2026-08-15.

### pending-deploys-runtime-classifier — CLOSED 2026-09-04 — **BUILT AND VERIFIED.** `pending_deploys.py` now computes script reachability transitively: 152 of 328 scripts are named by runtime code, 176 are tooling and excluded, and a VERDICT line answers "is a deploy warranted" directly. All six scripts observed running in production classify RUNTIME. 8 tests, CI OK. — opened 2026-09-04 — session cfcce46d-8ad8-4978-9992-5848cba4122a
- Goal: decide a catch-up round mechanically instead of hand-reading the file
  list, which is what rounds 8-11 each did. **Met.**
- Files: `scripts/pending_deploys.py`,
  `tests/test_pending_deploys_runtime.py` (NEW).
- **CONSERVATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION**, same asymmetry as `check_lane_invariants`:
  a false RUNTIME is noise, a false INERT hides a needed deploy. A script is
  demoted only on proof that no runtime file names it; the closure returns
  `None` ("treat all as executed") when the tree cannot be read.
- Verification (done): all six scripts seen in `deploy_preflight`'s live job
  listing — `refresh_odds_sources`, `build_soccer_artifacts`,
  `run_mlb_daily_sim_job`, `run_refresh_worker`, `run_live_odds_refresh_worker`,
  `run_refresh_odds_job` — classify RUNTIME. `f31a6db9` (`check_lane_claims.py`)
  dropped out of all three services' pending lists, which is the round-11 result
  reproduced mechanically.
- Residual, deliberate: five tooling scripts still read RUNTIME because runtime
  STRING literals name them. Noise in the safe direction; tightening further
  would risk false INERT, so it is left and documented.

- Goal: live-odds-worker off `ab42b221` onto `e713939f` `[user: "deploy
  4ead66c3"]`. `4ead66c3` (soccer corners get a model view from the CORNERS
  mean) is genuinely behavioural — 53 added lines of real code, not docstrings —

- Files: NONE — deploy only. Does not claim the shared ledger.
- **refresh-worker ALREADY ON `4ead66c3`** (a peer shipped it; 0 pending).
- **WEB EXCLUDED.** `web-oom-rate-remeasure` has held its claim 25 min and is

  accumulator its method depends on. Same call as round 9. Not forced.

The withheld-last-round concern was re-checked not assumed: claim released, no build in flight, 85 min uptime. — opened 2026-09-04 — session cfcce46d-8ad8-4978-9992-5848cba4122a
- Goal: web off `b3966bf1` onto `906f9537` `[user: "deploy web too", after I
  flagged the tradeoff and they reaffirmed]`. Carries `4ead66c3` (soccer corners
  model view), the same behavioural commit the workers already run.
- Files: NONE — deploy only. Does not claim the shared ledger.
- **THE CONCERN I RAISED, AND ITS RESOLUTION.** I withheld web last round because
  `web-oom-rate-remeasure` held the claim and a reboot resets the memory
  accumulator its method depends on. Since then: that claim is RELEASED, no build
  is in flight, and web has been up **85 minutes** — well past the 25-min window
  the method needs. The user reaffirmed after the tradeoff was stated.
- Verification: BY CONTENT on the deployed SHA — `corners_mean` in
  `soccer_projections.py`, confirmed ABSENT from the currently-live `b3966bf1`;
  plus web serving MLB cards and `/api/portfolio/summary`; plus 0 tracebacks.

## 2026-08-17 - THE LEDGER IS A RECORD, NOT EVIDENCE (the inverse of the same day's other lesson)

I relayed *"two uncommitted soccer fixes at risk of being lost"* to the
coordinator as an action item. **It came from a lane entry, not from a
measurement.** `git status` was empty and fix #1 was already on main.

**This is the exact inverse of the three errors recorded above it today.** There
I called healthy things BROKEN from a null lookup. Here I called a committed
thing AT RISK from a written claim I never checked. **Same root cause: treating
a statement as a reading.**

`.syndicate/**` records what was true WHEN WRITTEN. This lane was last touched
two days before I quoted it. **Before acting on or forwarding a ledger claim
about the state of the working tree - uncommitted work, missing files, a broken
service - re-measure it.** The cost here was small (a wrong action item, since
retracted). The cost of the reverse - deleting or "rescuing" files on a stale
claim - would not have been.

#### LANE RELEASE — session `bd97b64e` / `7c041356`, 2026-08-18 ~01:4xZ. **ALL HOLDS RELEASED. No file in this repo is claimed by this session any more.**

Released, with status:
- **`wnba-fixture-identity` — CLOSED.** Identity module + 40 tests shipped and on
  `main`. `game_cards` coverage fix proven on the real artifact (1 row → 3).
- **`wnba-phase2-migration` — CLOSED, code shipped, NOT ENABLED.** Autorun
  (`e65a5531`) + tests (`c7494c6c`). Its env keys are live on live-odds-worker
  and **inert until the code deploys**; it then goes hot on the FIRST tick,
  because the flag is already on and `last_epoch=0`.
- **`modelled-fair-edge` — CLOSED.** `edge_vs_modelled_fair_pct` shipped; 228 of
  258 both-terms MLB rows priced on the real payload. **NOT deployed.**
- **`soccer-projection-collapse` — CLOSED, root cause fixed, NOT deployed.**
  `#379`'s widening was inert; its only caller never passed `window_dates`.
- **`wnba-live-tier` — HOLD RELEASED.** I edited exactly ONE file under it,
  `board_enrichment.py`, one call site, on explicit user instruction ("no one has
  it"). **Everything else in that lane is untouched and its other claims stand.**
- **`export-force-refresh-escape` — CLOSED EARLIER BY OVERRIDE** (unattended
  holder, user-authorized). **Its effect measurement is still OWED and was NOT
  discharged by that close.**

**Session markers `.current-lane.7c041356-…` and `.current-lane.bd97b64e-…`
DELETED.** The other markers in that directory belong to other sessions —
including the coordinator's `9ed7fd89` — and were **not touched**.

**WHAT THE NEXT SESSION SHOULD NOT REDO:** everything above is on `main` with
tests. The remaining work is DEPLOY-GATED, not code-gated. Two requests sit with
the coordinator: **Phase 2 WNBA** and the **soccer projection window** (largest
measured effect, and it unblocks ~1,131 of the 1,416 rows the `book_margin_model`
decision was about).
