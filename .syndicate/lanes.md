## CLOSED THIS SESSION

### board-transport — CLOSED 2026-08-13 (work measured 08-10/11)
- Goal: the board computes correctly every cycle and cannot cross the transport.
- Files (exclusive to this lane while open):
  - `pipeline/intelligence_state.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/refresh_state_store.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/memory_observability.py`
  - `syndicate/blueprints/ops.py` (trace blocks only)
  - `scripts/deploy_preflight.py`, `tests/test_state_freshness.py`,
    `tests/test_candidate_trace_reads.py`, `tests/test_deploy_preflight.py`
- CLOSED: `#317` transport, `#322` state cache, `#324` keyvalue residency,
  `#327` memory instrument, `#334` freshness reporting, `#337` write-path count.
- **OPEN and handed back:** `#338` (serve reads `query_state_cache` at 150 while
  `board_snapshot` stores 220 — cause not localised), `#332` (NFL autorun guard,
  filed not fixed).
- **Blocked on another lane:** `#336`/`#338` are downstream of `#285`'s memory
  ratchet. The overview guard needs **~725MB** it does not have
  (3000MB floor vs 2275.5MB measured headroom), so it aborts at
  `sports_done=0 sports_total=8` and the candidate pool is empty by construction.
- All commits are ancestors of `478edd78`. No uncommitted work from this lane.

### sim-execution-observability — CLOSED-PENDING-MEASUREMENT 2026-08-13
- Goal: measure sim execution per sport (when/how long/how often/what triggers
  a re-sim), then fix what the measurement exposed.
- Files (exclusive to this lane):
  - `syndicate/features/shared/live_refresh_loop.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/sim_run_ledger.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/odds_book_quotes.py`
  - `syndicate/features/nfl/sources.py`
  - `scripts/run_refresh_worker.py`
  - `scripts/refresh_odds_sources.py`
  - `syndicate/blueprints/ops.py`
  - `syndicate/blueprints/home.py` (segment profiler only)
  - `syndicate/features/intelligence.py` (SLOW_GAME_CANDIDATE only)
- SHIPPED AND VERIFIED: `#388` (orphan cause recorded, observed twice in prod),
  `#389` + artifact-root fix (guard and writer share one resolver),
  `#390` (sim run ledger + `/api/ops/sims/ledger`), `#393` closed as
  root-caused-no-code-change.
- **OPEN AND UNMEASURED: where the board-build cost lives.** `448e1816` is live
  (`15:27:25Z`) carrying `SLOW_SEGMENT_PROFILE` (named segments, rows vs tail)
  and `_QUOTE_JOIN_STATS` (identity resolution by reason + `rows_walked`).
  Neither has emitted: the line is gated per-GAME at 5s and daytime games are
  ~0.4s each.
- Verification still required: one EVENING build (historically 20:49-00:45Z),
  then read one line:
  - `tail_s` >> `rows_s` -> cost is post-loop; `enrich_block` names it
  - `rows_s` >> `tail_s` -> the row loop is implicated after all
  - `by_teams_fallthrough` ~= `calls` with large `rows_walked` -> the cheap
    `event_id` key never matches, as predicted
- Blocked by: nothing. Needs an evening slate only.
- CAUTION: the previous instrument in this lane produced a confident wrong
  answer (see `learnings.md`). Read the segment NAMES, not the totals.

### soccer-sim-grouping — CLOSED 2026-08-10 — shipped and verified, one thread handed on
- Goal: `#282` break the soccer sim into per-league groups. Grew into `#311`,
  `#312`, `#327` as each surfaced from the one before.
- Files (exclusive to this lane):
  - `scripts/refresh_odds_sources.py`
  - `scripts/run_refresh_worker.py`
  - `scripts/audit_blueprint_drift.py` (new)
  - `syndicate/features/shared/ops_refresh.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/live_lens_loop.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/memory_observability.py`
  - `tests/test_live_lens_loop_publish_instrumentation.py` (new)
- **SHIPPED AND VERIFIED:** `#282` (8 launches, full rotation), `#311` (cap
  fired 16:06:31Z, first time ever, on the autorun path that was broken),
  `#327` instrument work (ring + high-water + in-sweep sampler all confirmed).
- **SHIPPED, MECHANISM UNTESTED:** `#312` — `f1bba90c` on `main`, live on
  nothing (its only deploy was cancelled). `render.yaml` change parked on
  branch **`hold/312-sync-false`**, deliberately off `main`.
- **OPEN, HANDED ON:** `#327 RESIDUAL` — the allocator is unattributed after
  five eliminations. Next action is one small change: record **bytes** on the
  pull and sweep paths beside the existing counts.
- No production change from this lane; all deploys were the oversight lane's.


### layer1-live-tier — CLOSED-PENDING-MEASUREMENT 2026-08-13
- Goal: Layer 1 board carries live projection, sim projection and actual-so-far
  on live rows, with correct live game state; retire `book_grid`.
- Files (exclusive to this lane):
  - `syndicate/features/shared/live_projection_join.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/board_enrichment.py`
  - `syndicate/features/shared/book_grid.py`
  - `syndicate/templates/shared/layer1_board.html`
  - `syndicate/templates/book_grid.html` (deleted)
  - `vendor/mlb_bettingv2/sim_engine/live_mc.py`
  - `vendor/mlb_bettingv2/tools/web/flask_frontend.py`
- SHIPPED AND VERIFIED: `#412` (prop join 0 -> 41), `#413` (live state,
  210 rows corrected), `#415` (Betting Board), `#411` (superseded lines).
- **OPEN AND UNVERIFIED: `#416`.** Writer emits live probabilities
  (`priced: 71`/`74`); `rows_live_edged` is still 0 on every build. The
  measurement is not yet READABLE — `e054e19f` splits the counter by game
  state so the `live` bucket can be read without final-game zeros diluting it.
- Verification still required: one build against a slate with live games, then
  read `snapshot_by_game_state["live"]`.
  - `{rows>0, with_live_prob>0}` -> working, edge should follow
  - `{rows>0, with_live_prob=0, with_live_projection>0}` -> writer half failing
  - `{rows: 0}` -> still no live slate, no verdict
- Blocked by: nothing. Needs a live slate only.

### internal-hostname-cutover — CLOSED 2026-08-13 — verified in production
- Verification met: every `PUBLISH_OK` line on refresh-worker at `14:54:11Z`
  carries `url=http://syndicate-an21:10000/api/ops/artifact...`, publishes
  succeeding (`published_hot_artifacts count=14 failed=0`), and
  `PUBLISH_BUDGET uploads=915 used_mb=302.4 ceiling_mb=20480.0`.
- Durability: `render.yaml` carries the internal hostname for both workers, so
  a `blueprint_sync` reinforces the fix instead of reverting it — the one thing
  that could silently have undone it.
- Report committed at `eaf7965d`; tickets now point at it (`3447f983`).

### (superseded lane detail, kept for the file/line map)

### internal-hostname-cutover — CLOSED — opened 2026-08-13 — session: <name>
- Goal: `SYNDICATE_WEB_PUBLISH_URL` points at the internal private-network
  hostname; worker→web traffic no longer leaves the Render network.
- Files:
  - `render.yaml` — env definition. Two blocks, one per worker:
    L418 (`refresh-worker`), L778 (`live-odds-worker`). Both already read
    `http://syndicate-an21:10000` (internal) in the repo. Hostname is
    `syndicate-an21`, NOT `syndicate`.
  - `syndicate/features/shared/artifact_publisher.py` — the only runtime
    reader. Five sites: `_publish_url()` L567, `_export_url()` L1077,
    the pull configuration gate L1230–1231, `_stream_url()` L1614, and
    the single-artifact stream gate L1664.
  - `tests/test_artifact_publisher.py` — asserts full URLs built from the
    var (e.g. L342, L470–480, L522); fixture value is a public
    `https://syndicate.onrender.com`, so a cutover touches it.
  - **No hardcoded fallback exists for this var.** Every read goes through
    `_env("SYNDICATE_WEB_PUBLISH_URL")` and returns `""` / skips when
    unset — absent means "publishing off", not "publish to the public URL".
    `[from-code 08-13]`
- Hypothesis: n/a (root cause confirmed from code)
- Falsification test: n/a
- Verification: service-initiated egress on `live-odds-worker` drops to
  near zero within one full sweep cycle; artifacts still publish
  successfully (non-zero publish count, no 5xx in worker logs).
- Blocked by: none
