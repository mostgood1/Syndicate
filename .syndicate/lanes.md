#### ORPHAN SWEEP 2026-08-18 ~21:4xZ — 8 lanes RELEASED, 32 claims dropped, contested-file invariant CLEARED

**Measured with `lane-guard.py`'s OWN `_claims()`**, not the simplified copy in
`check_lane_invariants.py` — the two disagree, and the difference decides
outcomes. The checker lacks the guard's `_is_disclaimer` / `_claimable_prefix`
handling, so it reported 70 claims / 12 OPEN lanes where the guard actually saw
**102 claims / 17 OPEN lanes**. Read the guard when the question is "is this
file guarded"; the checker answers a different, looser question.

    claims         102 -> 70          OPEN lanes holding claims  17 -> 9
    contested       1  -> 0           (live_gameline_join.py)
    OPEN-under-Archived  15 -> 7

**RELEASED (owner session archived or role retired, verified against the full
roster INCLUDING archived — `include_archived: false` hides exactly the
evidence this question needs):**

| lane | owning session | why released |
|---|---|---|
| `syndicate-coordinator` | `syndicate-coordinator` | role RETIRED by user decision; all 3 "Deploy and Document Coordinator" sessions archived |
| `clv-without-settlement` | `lane-cleanup` | = "Orphaned lanes cleanup", archived 08-16 01:14 |
| `layer2-board-quality` | `layer2-board-quality` | all 3 "Layer 2 board audit" sessions archived; the block itself said claims "can be released on request" |
| `wnba-live-tier` | `layer1-board-coverage` | all 6 "Layer 1 board coverage audit" forks archived — **this is what cleared the contested file** |
| `wnba-phase2-migration` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `modelled-fair-edge` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `odds-cadence-off-the-mlb-peak` | `sim-engine-track` | all 5 "Sim engine scheduling assessment" forks archived |
| `convergence-phase5-profile-seam` | `sim-scheduling` | same family, all archived |

**NOT RELEASED, DELIBERATELY — a live or plausibly-live owner exists.** Releasing
these would un-guard files a running session is editing, which is the exact
failure the lane system exists to prevent:

    basketball-model-owner    "Basketball model deep dive"   RUNNING
    nhl-model-owner           "NHL hockey model deep dive"   RUNNING
    soccer-model-dispersion   "Soccer Session (fork)"        RUNNING
    convergence-phase7-crps   "Modeling Session (fork 2)"    active today 21:40Z
    grading-blocker-settled-zero  "Betting settlement data"  RUNNING — plausible owner by SUBJECT, not by name; the header names `alt-line-shortlist-watch`. UNRESOLVED, left guarded.
    refresh-worker-oom-recurrence "Oom band full report"     flagged running (stale 40h)
    live-edge-basis           `ask-answer-substance`         no roster match; left guarded because it now SOLELY owns `live_gameline_join.py`
    repo-coordination         unmapped                       holds the global `.current-lane`; 9 claims
    ask-sport-coverage        `ask-sport-coverage`           owner family archived, but it sits correctly under `## OPEN` and is the digest's lead lane — flagged, not swept

**THE 7 REMAINING `OPEN`-UNDER-`## Archived lanes` ARE NOT MINE TO FIX.** Every
one belongs to a live or uncertain lane above, and the remedy is to MOVE the
block above the `## Archived lanes` marker — which is editing another lane's
block. Left for each owner. The hazard is real but latent: their claims work
today and would be dropped silently by a future archive pass.

**Method note for the next sweep.** `.syndicate/.current-lane.<uuid>` marker
filenames match archived `sessionId`s exactly (6 of 13 did), so a marker whose
id resolves to an ARCHIVED session is hard evidence the lane is orphaned. The
markers for running sessions did NOT match any roster id, so the mapping proves
death, never life — do not invert it.

## OPEN
### open-bet-live-status — OPEN, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — opened 2026-08-26 — session syndicate-27 (749848)
- Goal: `/portfolio` is the live buying engine — merged book, editable caps,
  venue balances, venue settlement, live status on open bets. `[user 2026-08-26]`
- Files: released: `blueprints/intelligence.py`,
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**

  `venue-refresh-decoupling` `[2026-08-28, session 3e5a9659]`** — an additive
  timing span around `join_polymarket_to_board`, NO behaviour change. Taken
  because this lane's session (`syndicate-27`) is NOT RUNNING (`list_sessions`
  shows every session `isRunning: false`) and the board build cannot attribute
  ~305s of CPU without it. **The SEMANTIC scope of this file stays yours** —
  side resolution, alias matching, the join's correctness. Take it back by
  striking this note.

  RELEASED `[2026-08-28, session d617eefd]`: `polymarket_board_join.py` (its
  SEMANTIC scope; the instrumentation-only transfer struck above stands).
  A marker governs ONLY ITS OWN LINE -- `_claimable_prefix` cuts at the first
  marker and keeps everything before it, so a path that WRAPS onto an unmarked
  continuation line is claimed in full. That is why each path above repeats the
  word rather than sharing one lead-in. All three are now
  held in full by `venue-join-refusal-visibility`, which is fixing the
  Polymarket soccer league-bucketing gap and the ops slate reader that
  disagrees with the join about it. Taken because this lane's session is
  ARCHIVED and not running -- verified in that session, not assumed:
  `list_sessions(include_archived=true)` shows `local_f08f0df5` "Portfolio
  page consolidation", `isArchived: true`, `isRunning: false`, last activity
  2026-08-27T21:51:49Z. Take them back by striking this note.
- **STATUS 2026-08-27T21:45Z — 11 commits landed, 6 verified in production,
  5 shipped-but-unfired. Narrative and all 7 self-corrections in
  `log/2026-08-27.md`; measurements in `deploys.md`.**
- **OWED, all trigger-gated, none forceable:**
  1. `cle-laa` home row — grace expired 21:44:25Z, predict `lost / -2.76`.
  2. WNBA city codes (`31575179`) + soccer pair (`fde862aa`) need a
     refresh-worker deploy; live there is behind.
  3. paused-retry and balance-gate need an exchange pause / a cash floor.
- **DO NOT re-derive:** NCAAF projections cannot complete before **1 Sept**
  (monthly CFBD quota exhausted, `X-CallLimit-Remaining: 0`); it relaunches
  every ~38s and crashes on `429` until then. `source=artifact` IS confirmed —
  the profile loads; the RUN fails downstream.
- Claims: NONE held (web released 20:44Z, live-odds-worker expired).

### convergence-phase7-crps — OPEN, **UNOWNED** `[session abf487e4 ARCHIVED 2026-08-20T21:1xZ]` — **FIVE FINDINGS: FOUR DEFECTS FIXED AND MEASURED, ONE NOT A DEFECT.** Ladder over the 12MB publish ceiling (pitcher strikeouts 0/12 → 18/18 rows with market lines, verified on the served payload); conditional mix never CALLED from the roster build; season-artifact pull matching NOTHING (bare globs vs fnmatch on full paths) — all five inputs now present on the worker. NOT a defect: `vs_pitcher_*` is unfed by `FORWARD_BVP_MATCHUP_MODE=off`, a modelling decision; reclassified as `disabled` so nfail means "wrong". **THE ONE THING OWED: verify on 2026-08-21** — first `sim_input_report_2026-08-21.json` via `/api/ops/artifacts/export?pattern=*sim_input_report*` must show `nfail` **10 → 0**; still 10 on a fresh `generated_at` means the wiring is INERT and this reopens. Claims: NONE held. Still open, deliberately not fixed: ephemeral `vendor/*/data/` statcast caches; BVP left OFF by design. — opened 2026-08-17
- **Goal (single testable outcome):** a proper scoring rule runs over CONTINUOUS
  projections joined to realized outcomes, with **no dependency on settlement,
  grading, or a placed bet**. `#440` Part 4 Phase 7. **MET** — 12k observations
  across two windows where settlement has produced 0.
- **Files (all NEW — collision-checked 2026-08-17 against all 14 OPEN lane
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: blocks on `origin/main`; zero overlap):**
  released: - `syndicate/features/shared/projection_score.py` (NEW)
  released: - `tests/test_projection_score.py` (NEW)
  released: - `scripts/score_projections.py` (NEW)
- **THE ONE THING OWED:** first `sim_input_report_<date>.json` via
  `/api/ops/artifacts/export?pattern=*sim_input_report*` must show `nfail`
  **10 → 0**. Still 10 on a fresh `generated_at` means the wiring is INERT and
  this reopens.
- **FALSIFICATION RESULT: Phase 7 is a 2-sport instrument, not 7.** Only MLB and
  WNBA/NBA carry a joinable spread. NHL, soccer and NCAAF are **UNMEASURED, NOT
  ABSENT** — re-check against PRODUCTION before anyone writes "no spread".
- **DO NOT BUILD A NEW JOIN.** `scripts/backtest_mlb_props.py` already solves
  archive-replay, the `batter_id` join, per-market denominators, DNP exclusion
  and baseline comparison. Phase 7 is the distribution half of a harness that
  already works, not a second harness.
- **THE `outs` LEASH IS CONFIRMED, AND DO NOT RE-REPORT IT AS A DISCOVERY.** The
  team measured this bias by tier and partly fixed it. Sim P(outs<15) 0.1036 vs
  actual 0.2961; 27% of sim mass sits at exactly 5.0 IP, the
  `starter_min_innings = 5` boundary. The over-projection is concentrated in mid
  and back-end starters and **elite starters are slightly UNDER-projected**, so a
  single global shift would make aces worse.
- **DO NOT "re-enable" `starter_tto_quality_scaling`.** Its 0.0 is a deliberate,
  evidence-based revert — it made strikeout hit rate WORSE (55.78% → 54.65%).
  Read the OVERRIDES file, not code defaults; I made that error and corrected it.
- **NOT ESTABLISHED:** that `manager_tendencies.json` is absent IN PRODUCTION
  (absent from the repo, never read off the Render disk). Confirm before acting.
- **Blocked by:** none.
- Full working record (measurements, phase log, hypothesis/falsification detail) moved VERBATIM to `.syndicate/lanes_history.md` at the 2026-08-31 compaction. Nothing was summarised away.

### soccer-model-dispersion — OPEN, UNOWNED (session `soccer-sport-owner` checkpointed and released 2026-08-20 ~13:3xZ) — TESTABLE OUTCOME NOT MET; DISPERSION FALSIFIED; DISCRIMINATION CONFIRMED AS THE REMAINING DEFECT; HOME-ADVANTAGE RE-FIT TRIED AND FAILED HELD-OUT VALIDATION
- Goal (unchanged, still NOT met): `backtest_soccer_h2h_calibration.py` reports
  model Brier **<= market** on at least one non-`belgian_pro_league` league.
- Files: released: `scripts/backtest_soccer_h2h_calibration.py`,
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: `scripts/build_soccer_artifacts.py`, `scripts/validate_soccer_vs_market.py`,
  released: `scripts/soccer_sim_input_checklist.py`, `syndicate/features/soccer/` (sim
  released: engine, adapters, ratings, `ingestion/espn_match_stats.py`),
  released: `tests/test_soccer_feature_loaders.py`, `tests/test_soccer_projections.py`,
  released: `tests/test_build_soccer_artifacts.py`, `tests/test_soccer_adapter.py`,
  released: `tests/test_soccer_advanced_input_reachability.py`,
  released: `tests/test_backtest_matches_production_rating_source.py`,
  released: `reports/soccer_backtest/`.
- **DISPERSION IS FALSIFIED — this lane's own pre-registered outcome fired.**
  Model stdev rose 0.1575 → 0.1922, PAST market's 0.1859, and the Brier gap did
  not close: worse than market in 8 of 9 leagues. Recorded as an OVERTURNED
  belief in `learnings.md` 2026-08-20.
- **DISCRIMINATION is the remaining defect.** Per-league AUC gap is the map:
  **serie_a (-0.055) and especially bundesliga (-0.111)** have real, unaddressed
  ranking deficiencies. That is the next thread — everything tried so far
  targeted the 5 leagues where ranking was already fine.
- **DO NOT re-open the input-quality list without new evidence that a specific
  field is systematically BIASED**, not merely present or absent. Every field
  was sourced, tested and disposed with a stated reason; none closed the gap.
- **ANY future single-parameter fit MUST clear a held-out validation** on
  different matches than the fit. `championship`'s home-advantage boost was the
  most trustworthy-looking in-sample result and FAILED held-out (+0.0121 Brier
  worse, t=+1.19). REVERTED, NOT COMMITTED. None of the other 4 candidates
  should be trusted either — they looked LESS solid than the one that failed.
- **INHERITED, DO NOT RE-DERIVE:** a leak-free backtest ALREADY EXISTS
  (`5a94b134`); MLS cannot be backtested from its current source (undated season
  aggregates); do not publish `model_edge_pct` on a partial win — publishing is a
  separate decision from closing the Brier gap.
- Blocked by: none.
- Full working record (measurements, phase log, hypothesis/falsification detail) moved VERBATIM to `.syndicate/lanes_history.md` at the 2026-08-31 compaction. Nothing was summarised away.

### wnba-live-odds-capture-gap — OPEN, NARROWED, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — **THE AUTORUN FIRED FOR REAL `[2026-08-21T00:07:24.782Z / 19:07 CT]`, observed by a third party (scheduled task `verify-wnba-live-scale-481`, session `1f76348c`) on IND@DAL. The "never fired" blocker is DISCHARGED. What replaces it: the autorun launches every ~4.3 min and refreshes the LIVE-LENS path, but `book_quotes/<date>.jsonl` advanced ONCE (00:07:49Z) and was still byte-identical 26 min later. The lane's literal testable outcome PASSES, but passing cannot be attributed to the autorun — see FINDINGS.** **ROOT CAUSE FOUND `[00:45Z]`: the autorun is fine; `refresh_wnba_oddsapi_props.py`'s REUSE GUARD sits upstream of it and returns `reused_artifact_bundle` every tick, so the child that appends `book_quotes` never spawns. The guard's staleness bound is the PREGAME sweep interval (2h) and its reuse key carries no phase term, so a 240s live autorun cannot outrun it. THE FIX BELONGS IN THE GUARD, NOT THE AUTORUN.** — opened 2026-08-20 — session 2bffd747-efb5-45d8-b4f3-ae067b645eb7
- Goal: WNBA's in-game (live-phase) odds capture actually refreshes once a game
  goes live, instead of freezing at its last pregame quote. **Testable outcome:**
  for a live WNBA game, `wnba_source/tracking/book_quotes/<date>.jsonl` carries a
  `captured_at` newer than kickoff.
- Files:
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  - **CLAIM RELEASED 2026-08-20 to `wnba-live-reuse-bound`** (session
    `1f76348c`), narrowly and by this lane's own instruction below. The defect
    location IS now confirmed and it is not in this file — only `_build_wnba_steps`
    needs one line to pass the phase to the child. This lane is UNOWNED (session
    `2bffd747` absent from the roster including archived), so holding a
    read-only reference here would block the fix this lane exists to enable.
    Path deliberately NOT written as a path on this line, because
    released: `check_lane_invariants.py` parses any backticked path inside a `- Files:`
    block as a live CLAIM and would keep reporting the file as contested.
    Formerly: the WNBA step builder, read-only reference, "do not edit without
    re-claiming narrowly, same convention the soccer lane used for this same
    file" — which is exactly what was done.
  - Not claimed, read-only reference: `scripts/run_live_odds_refresh_worker.py`
    — likely relevant (soccer's autorun equivalent lived here), not yet
    confirmed WNBA has an analogous live-phase launcher at all.
- **ROOT CAUSE FOUND, AND THE FIX IS NOT IN THE AUTORUN.** The autorun fires
  correctly (`WNBA_LIVE_AUTORUN_LAUNCHED` on a clean ~4.3 min cadence against a
  REAL live game, zero errors). `refresh_wnba_oddsapi_props.py`'s REUSE GUARD
  sits upstream and returns `reused_artifact_bundle` every tick, so the child
  that appends `book_quotes` never spawns. Its staleness bound is the PREGAME
  sweep interval (2h) and its reuse key `(artifact_root, date, do_edges,
  do_export)` carries **no phase and no time term**, so a 240s live tick is
  indistinguishable from a pregame one. **THE FIX BELONGS IN THE GUARD.**
- **Do NOT touch the autorun; it works.** The combined-sweep / MLB-starvation
  suspicion was traced and is EXONERATED for this symptom.
- **Re-verify with the last-seen slot and `/api/ops/wnba/refresh-decision`, NOT
  with `.jsonl` row counts.** `append_book_quotes` is a CHANGE log, so a flat
  file proves nothing on its own; the state file's last-seen slot is what
  separates "prices stable" from "nothing observed". All 5,489 keys read
  36+ min cold — nothing was observed.
- **The testable outcome PASSED but does not prove the mechanism** — batch
  spacing of 84-162 min produces a post-kickoff batch with no autorun at all.
  The 25s gap between launch and capture is suggestive, NOT probative.
  **Do not close on it.**
- **UNVERIFIED:** the 2h bound is the CODE DEFAULT with no `render.yaml`
  override; live service env-vars were never read, so a service-level override
  is still possible.
- **Adjacent, not this lane's:** live-odds-worker hit **97.2% of its 2GB cap
  (43.6MB headroom)** with three live games.
- **A line in this block's history belongs to a DIFFERENT lane** — an
  "Outcome:" about Polymarket `tsc-mlb-lad-det` quote pricing. Preserved
  verbatim in `lanes_history.md`; it is not this lane's finding.
- Blocked by: none.
- Full working record moved VERBATIM to `.syndicate/lanes_history.md` at the 2026-08-31 compaction. Nothing was summarised away.

### soccer-board-mlb-parity — OPEN, UNOWNED (session `f98be73b` checkpointed 2026-08-22 23:2xZ) — **TWO THINGS DEPLOYED TONIGHT. (1) `#518` FOTMOB MOMENTUM — live-odds-worker `94a16efe`, live 22:18:35Z: the event-signal sweep (momentum/xG/shot pressure) was killed by a null control, but a pooled 60-120s model IS real and DIRECTIONAL (which team scores next, dAUC +0.071), driven by FotMob's own momentum series; production's ESPN proxy carries NO signal at any half-life — retired. 5,552-match dataset committed. (2) COMPACT CARD REDESIGN — web `a1dc1e9a`, live 23:08:55Z, VERIFIED ON PRODUCTION HTML: pregame cards show sim-projected totals + BTTS/goals/corners/top-score; final cards RECONCILE those same facts against the real result (19 hit/62 miss on today's slate, spot-checked by hand).** OWED: (a) the FotMob join has never resolved a real fixture — MLS kickoff 2026-08-23T01:30Z is the first test; (b) the live-odds market-pricing pilot sits at 1.46 SE, n=106, needs ~2 more match-days. Full detail: `state.md [soccer-live-momentum]` + `[soccer-compact-cards]`, `log/2026-08-22.md` 22:0x-23:1xZ entries. — opened 2026-08-20 — session f98be73b-b686-42b7-bdf9-248ab97f65b7
- Goal (unchanged): `/soccer` serves a date-scoped board whose cards carry the
  same information classes MLB's do, and whose live tier updates during a match.
- Files: released: `syndicate/features/shared/{board_enrichment,soccer_live_gameline_source,soccer_projections,layer2_board,publication_adapter,live_lens_loop}.py`,
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: `syndicate/features/soccer/{features/live_lens.py,features/lineups.py,ingestion/fotmob_*.py}`,
  **the soccer cards builder was REMOVED FROM THE BRACE ABOVE
  `[2026-08-28, session 3e5a9659]`** —
  claim transferred to `soccer-overview-cost` for INSTRUMENTATION ONLY (two
  sub-marks inside `_build_cards_page_context_uncached`, no behaviour change,
  released: nothing near the FotMob/live-lens work this lane owns). Taken because this
  lane is UNOWNED — session `f98be73b` checkpointed 2026-08-22 and does not
  appear in `list_sessions` at all. REMOVED rather than struck through, and
  removed from INSIDE the brace: `check_lane_invariants` parses paths
  positionally and a brace expansion is a claim per member. To reclaim, put
  that filename back inside the brace.
  **AND THE FILENAME ITSELF HAD TO GO, not just its position in the brace**
  `[2026-08-29, session 6dc988f8, lane ncaaf-live-lens-state]` — this note
  said the claim was removed while still spelling the bare filename twice
  inside the `- Files:` block, so `_claims()` kept yielding it. `lane-guard`
  released: matches on path SUFFIX (`rel.endswith("/" + f)`, line 420), and a bare
  filename has no directory to disambiguate it, so this UNOWNED soccer lane
  was claiming **every sport's cards builder** — mlb, nba, nfl, ncaaf, wnba.
  It blocked an NCAAF edit on 2026-08-29 while the first game of the season
  was in progress. `check_lane_invariants` did NOT catch it: it checks that
  each claim has exactly one holder, and this claim did. Same basename
  released: collision `state.md` records for `live_lens` across eight sports. **A
  disclaimer next to a path does not unclaim it — only deleting the path
  text does.**
  released: `syndicate/templates/shared/_scoreboard_strip_soccer.html`, `syndicate/static/shared/dense_cards.css`,
  released: `scripts/{build_soccer_artifacts,backtest_soccer_live_totals,poll_soccer_live_state,soccer_*}.py`,
  released: `tests/test_soccer_*`, `tests/test_fotmob_*`.
- **OWED, and not claimed as done:**
  1. **The FotMob join has never resolved a real fixture.**
  2. **Gate 3 has never been observed PRICING a live edge** — only withholding by
     name. Needs a live soccer market quoted two-sided.
  3. **The live totals lens is unproven** — harness ran n=1 with NEUTRAL ratings.
  4. **Two fair bases on one market**: home rows use `soccer_projections`' de-vig,
     away/draw use layer2's `quote.fair_probability`. Residual median 0.47 /
     max 1.38 pts.
  5. Five of six ESPN-join collision pairs (incl. Manchester City ↔ Manchester
     United, 0.812) fixed BY CONSTRUCTION and never rebuilt in production.
  6. The live-odds market-pricing pilot sits at 1.46 SE, n=106 — needs ~2 more
     match-days.
- **`board_enrichment._side_matches` WAS FIXED BY ANOTHER LANE** `[2026-08-29,
  lane ncaaf-chip-grid-join]` — arguments were inverted; 0/8 as called, 8/8
  reversed. Soccer gains 5 matched rows (285 → 290); no sport loses a match.
- **A DISCLAIMER NEXT TO A PATH DOES NOT UNCLAIM IT — only deleting the path text
  does.** This lane's bare `cards.py` filename claimed EVERY sport's cards
  builder (`lane-guard` matches on path SUFFIX) and blocked an NCAAF edit during
  the first game of the season. `check_lane_invariants` did not catch it: the
  claim had exactly one holder.
- **NOT IN THIS LANE:** `syndicate/features/soccer/sim_engine/`, adapters,
  ratings — held by `soccer-model-dispersion`.
- Blocked by: none.

### wnba-halftime-elapsed — **OPEN, UNOWNED** `[session 1f76348c ARCHIVED 2026-08-21 ~16:1xZ]` — **ONE READING OWED** — fix is LIVE on web (`2b9040df`, content-verified) and on the workers (`3b41696d` is an ancestor of refresh-worker's SHA). Unit-verified both directions: 3 break tests FAIL pre-fix, 2 narrowness tests PASS in both states. **THE BREAK BEHAVIOUR ITSELF IS UNOBSERVED IN PRODUCTION** — a 20-minute watcher caught no blank-clock state, and the one suggestive reading (a board row at 'End of 1st' keeping a live lane at model 0.2155 vs its 0.27 pregame baseline) was INDIRECT, via the board. Next WNBA break discharges it. — opened 2026-08-20 — session 1f76348c-062d-4075-a54b-a8b0eadabb2b
- Goal: the live win/cover probability must keep using the live margin during a
  BETWEEN-PERIODS break instead of silently reverting to the pregame number.
  **Testable outcome:** with period=2 and a blank clock, a +12 and a -12 home
  margin produce DIFFERENT probabilities (today both return the pregame anchor).

- **ONE READING OWED — the break behaviour itself is UNOBSERVED IN PRODUCTION.**
  A 20-minute watcher caught no blank-clock state; the one suggestive reading was
  INDIRECT, via the board. Next WNBA break discharges it.
- **Falsification test that still matters:** if a blank clock ALSO occurs at a
  period's START, then "blank clock = period complete" overstates elapsed by a
  full period and this fix is WRONG in that state. The narrow fix was chosen for
  exactly this reason — confirm against a real captured halftime payload before
  generalising.

### wnba-live-props-data — **OPEN, UNOWNED** `[session 1f76348c 2026-08-21T17:4xZ]` — **PROPS CHAIN BUILT+DEPLOYED (UNPROVEN); `#499` TOTALS PRICING DEPLOYED (UNPROVEN).** Live on BOTH workers at `8d5d6edf` (refresh-worker 16:43:05Z, live-odds-worker 16:48:04Z) — totals scale `3.2` + `ANALYTIC_LIVE_STD_ERR_BY_MARKET {("wnba","totals"): 0.150}` + the fix for it shipping INERT. **TWO READINGS OWED, BOTH BLOCKED ON A LIVE SLATE, BOTH ARMED:** scheduled task `verify-wnba-totals-pricing-499` fires 19:15 CDT 2026-08-21 carrying both. (a) `#499` PASSES only if totals rows refuse as `prob_interval_swamps_edge` (per-row) NOT `analytic_estimator_never_backtested_for_this_market` (category-wide); at sigma=0.150 the bar is ~30pp so **priceable volume is a BUG signal, not success**. (b) `#498` props PASSES only on `WNBA_LIVE_BOX_CAPTURED` with players (live-odds-worker) AND `live_projections.rows_live_projected` > 0. Pre-tip both read 0 — **a zero is indistinguishable from an inert feature**; verifier `scripts/verify_wnba_totals_pricing.py` exits 3 rather than 0 for that reason. DO NOT report either as working.

- Goal: live WNBA props. **Phase 1 (THIS LANE): persist the live per-player stat
  lines so a worker can read them.** The data was never missing —
  `/wnba/api/live_player_boxscore` serves it and always has, but it is fetched in
  the REQUEST PATH on web while the prop join runs on a WORKER, so there is no
  artifact to read. **Capture VERIFIED 2026-08-21 03:37Z: `games=2

  (a) `#499` totals PASSES only if rows refuse as `prob_interval_swamps_edge`

  reason — treat exit 3 as "not measured", never as a pass.

- **Status: three defects found, all FIXED AND DEPLOYED. The goal is NOT met —
  nothing has settled yet.** `#502` ledger crosses the service boundary
  (`2aa1df54`); `#504` settlement 13th -> 2nd in the chain (`4eeffb5c`, verified
  1.3ms); `#505` join on a stable identity (`a1e89ff3`, refresh-worker only).
- **Unverified and load-bearing:** `#505`'s `entity` field mapping was never
  measured against real evaluation records (worker-local, not in
  `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS`).
- **The backfill tool is BUILT and NOT RUN against production.** Its in-session
  preview proved the TOOL works and nothing about production.
- **Verification owed, and it GATES the backfill:** the next `[ledger_bridge]`
  line. `matched_by_identity > 0` = the join works; `by_identity` large with
  `matched_by_identity: 0` = the entity mapping is wrong. **Do not run the
  backfill with `--commit` before that reading.**

- Goal: line-aware Kalshi rungs. **DO NOT RESUME THE ORIGINAL GOAL FIRST** —
  it is currently unjustified and blocked on two measurements below.
- **CLAIMS RELEASED. The files below are FREE to take.** The lane stays OPEN
  because real work remains, but no live session holds it. Nothing is
  uncommitted: tree clean at `d2d44dbaf`, all shipped code live under `34717822`.

  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**

  Written without `.py` so the guard stops enforcing paths this lane released.

  venue_quote_adapters, venue_quote_fanin and kalshi_odds_refresh were
  re-claimed by `venue-quote-line-join` on 2026-08-27. Naming them INSIDE
  `Files:` turned them back into claims and this lane — session GONE, claims
  RELEASED — went on blocking edits to files it had given up. Filenames are
  written without `.py` on purpose.
- **BLOCKED ON, in order. Do NOT write an eviction change before both:**
  1. `PRECAP_CUT_BY_DATE` taken **during a live slate**. The `03:11Z` reading is
     post-slate and systematically understates it (`KXMLBHRR` cut 747 at 01:49Z,
     132 at 03:11Z). Code is live; this needs only a reading.
  2. The **outer `MAX_STORED_MARKETS` trim dated the same way**.
     `cut_total=3940` vs `TICK trimmed=8744` — ~4,800 markets cut by a second
     date-blind bound that nothing dates.
- **FOUR HYPOTHESES KILLED, none by argument** — including "eviction
  re-prioritisation recovers ~1,600 markets", measured at **133**. One is now
  STALE: NCAAF DOES reach the board side since `5e6ef685`; **a successor must
  re-measure rather than inherit these numbers.**

  date bucket. Start there.

### kalshi-spread-join-sign — **OPEN (reopened 2026-08-26)** — session syndicate-43 (ENDED) — UNOWNED — six things verified; WNBA settlement is BUILT, LANDED and NOT DEPLOYED
- Goal: Kalshi spread join sign, and WNBA/soccer settlement. Six things
  verified; WNBA settlement is BUILT, LANDED and NOT DEPLOYED.
- Note: this lane was CLOSED earlier on 2026-08-26 and its block moved to
  `lanes_history.md`. Work continued after that close, so this is a fresh block
  for what is still OWED — the history entry stays as the record.

- **OWED, in priority order:**
  1. **DEPLOY refresh-worker, THEN read `SETTLED date=2026-08-25`.** PASSES only
     if `not_decided_yet` falls below 6 and Citron (1 reb vs over 3.5) / Amoore
     (3 ast vs over 3.5) grade **LOST**. **DO NOT REPORT WNBA SETTLEMENT AS
     FIXED BEFORE THAT READING** — and treat its all-time `win 100%` as
     wins-only BY CONSTRUCTION until a loss can settle.
  2. **Re-do the 2026-05-25..08-26 backfill through the KEYVALUE store.** The 84
     files published via `/api/ops/artifacts/publish` sit on WEB'S FILESYSTEM
     while the consumer reads keyvalue on refresh-worker.
  3. **Soccer: still 0 settled all-time.** The read is fixed; needs an order
     whose match finished with finals captured after 2026-08-26T16:11Z.
  4. **Polymarket side resolution UNRESOLVED.** `over`->YES/`under`->NO is a
     fixed constant while the price comes from the name-matched index, and the
     `outcomes` array orientation VARIES per market. A cross-check guard was
     built and **REVERTED** — it silently enthroned the positional reading, the
     disputed question. `FILL_ABOVE_LIMIT` ships as detection only.
  5. **33 pre-existing test failures** in soccer/board selection, confirmed NOT
     caused by this lane (identical counts with and without the change).

TWO THINGS OWED — refresh-worker is not deployed, and the projection guard is UNIT-TESTED ONLY. `todo.md #586`.** **CHECKPOINT 2026-08-27T01:2xZ: refresh-worker reached `070f452a` and DOES carry the fix; the WNBA half is owed on a MISSING SUBJECT, not a missing deploy — `WNBA live=0` when the artifact landed. Next window TOR @ SEA `02:00Z`. Session archived; lane UNOWNED.**
- Goal: a live WNBA game chip carries its QUARTER AND CLOCK (`Q3 5:23`) instead
  of a bare `LIVE` token. **Clock FIXED AND VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION** (web
  `e3dceb68`): `LIVE` → `Q3 20.5`, control and after on the same game against
  ESPN.
- Files: released: `tests/test_home_wnba_live_state.py`
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
released: - **`syndicate/blueprints/home.py` IS NOT LISTED ABOVE ON PURPOSE `[2026-08-28,
  session 3e5a9659]`.** Its claim moved to `soccer-overview-cost` for
  INSTRUMENTATION ONLY — per-league timing inside the soccer games loop, no
  released: behaviour change, nothing near the WNBA chip/live-token work this lane owns.
  Taken because this lane is marked UNOWNED (session 3dcd0fb2 checkpointed and
  ARCHIVED 2026-08-27). To reclaim, put the path back on the `- Files:` line.
  **THE PATH IS REMOVED RATHER THAN STRUCK THROUGH** because
  released: `check_lane_invariants.py` parses paths POSITIONALLY and a `~~struck~~` path
  released: is still a live claim — that is a standing rule in `learnings.md` and I broke
  it here first, producing a false contest between two OPEN lanes.
  — RELEASED (see the note below) — `game_chip_scoreboard.py` was ADDED here
  after the first test run, because refusing to SET a fractional score in
  released: `home.py` was not enough: `_side_score` falls through to
  `live_state.<side>_pts` and picks the projection back up.
  — **RELEASED: `syndicate/features/shared/game_chip_scoreboard.py` IS NO
  LONGER LISTED ABOVE, ON PURPOSE `[2026-08-28, session 28195565, user
  authorised]`.** Its claim moved to `mlb-final-zero-placeholder` for the
  0-0 placeholder branch
  inside `build_game_chip` ONLY — the code that runs AFTER `_side_score`
  returns. **`_side_score` and its `live_state.<side>_pts` fallthrough — this
  lane's actual subject — are UNTOUCHED, as is everything WNBA.** Taken because
  this lane is UNOWNED (session 3dcd0fb2 ARCHIVED 2026-08-27) and an MLB
  scoring defect traced to that branch: a 0-0 schedule placeholder on a game
  whose status had advanced to FINAL was passed through as an observed result.
  **THE PATH IS REMOVED RATHER THAN STRUCK THROUGH**, for the same reason the
  released: `home.py` note above gives — a `~~struck~~` path is still a live claim to
  released: both `lane-guard.py` and `check_lane_invariants.py`, which read positionally.
  (Confirmed here: the guard's disclaimer vocabulary is a fixed list —
  `not claimed`, `released`, `held by`, `claimed by`, … — and "TRANSFERRED" is
  not in it, so a prose transfer note alone releases nothing.)
  **CONSEQUENCE, stated plainly: the guard now protects this file for NEITHER
  lane.** There is no way to express a per-branch claim to it. To reclaim, put
  the path back on the `- Files:` line.
- **OWED 1 — the WNBA half is owed on a MISSING SUBJECT, not a missing deploy.**
  refresh-worker reached `070f452a` and DOES carry the fix; `WNBA live=0` when
  the artifact landed. Discharge on a live WNBA slate:
  `/api/board/game-chips?sports=wnba` must return a period-and-clock token.
- **OWED 2 — the projection guard is UNIT-TESTED ONLY** and must not be recorded
  as verified.
- **MY OWN VERIFIER RETURNED A FALSE NEGATIVE ON THE PASSING RUN** — do not trust
  a red from it without reading the assertion.
- **A `~~struck~~` PATH IS STILL A LIVE CLAIM** to both `lane-guard.py` and
  `check_lane_invariants.py`, which read positionally. Striking a path does not
  release it; deleting the text does. This is a standing rule in `learnings.md`
  and this lane broke it.

### venue-quote-line-join — OPEN, **UNOWNED** (session 3515d143 archived 2026-08-27 ~21:45Z; ALL CLAIMS RELEASED, worktree clean, nothing uncommitted) — **SIX DEFECTS FIXED AND VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION; ONE CHANGE RECORDED AS UNPROVEN; TWO NAMED AND UNFIXED.** Verified: soccer unmatched **15,348 -> 4,006**, grid stamped **13.1% -> 66%**, prop keys now name their player (was a cross-sport WRONG-PLAYER match), kalshi quotes carry a price at all (`yes_bid` was never persisted) and both legs of a threshold market, NFL nicknames resolve (`clubs_unresolved` 64 -> 0), per-sport trim floor, and the venue poll on its own thread (kalshi ~1,250s -> ~120s, polymarket 428-828s -> ~120s). **UNPROVEN: the demand-weighted trim.** Allocation IS the binding constraint (`matched` tracks mlb slots: 794/27, 1620/208, 1741/218, 1706/221) but today's recovery came from MLB's slate approaching first pitch, NOT from the change -- the trim behind `matched=208` logged `demand=None`. **Its test is tomorrow MORNING CT, sustained; the morning was noisy (146/210/99 against a 5-27 baseline) so one good reading is not evidence.** I recorded 'supply not allocation' and had to RETRACT it -- see `deploys.md` 21:0xZ correction. **UNFIXED: a TOTALS key names no GAME** (672 polymarket soccer quotes -> SIX distinct keys, same class as the player-blind props); and the `842`-row builds match 0 on the COMPLETE set, never confirmed as a benign future-date board. Full narrative: `log/2026-08-27.md`.
- Goal: reduce `VENUE_REPRICE_KEYS unmatched_by_sport` for nfl/soccer/ncaaf.
  **SIX DEFECTS FIXED AND VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION:** soccer unmatched **15,348 →
  4,006**, grid stamped **13.1% → 66%**, prop keys now name their player (was a
  cross-sport WRONG-PLAYER match), kalshi quotes carry a price at all (`yes_bid`
  was never persisted) and both legs of a threshold market, NFL nicknames resolve
  (`clubs_unresolved` 64 → 0), per-sport trim floor, and the venue poll on its own
  thread (kalshi ~1,250s → ~120s, polymarket 428-828s → ~120s).
- **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-27 at session archive** — every file this lane held
  is free, including the live-odds worker entrypoint. The paths named in the
  history block are a RECORD, not a claim.
- **UNPROVEN: the demand-weighted trim.** Allocation IS the binding constraint,
  but the recovery came from MLB's slate approaching first pitch, NOT from the
  change — the trim behind `matched=208` logged `demand=None`. **Its test is a
  sustained MORNING CT reading; the morning was noisy (146/210/99 against a 5-27
  baseline) so one good reading is not evidence.**
- **I recorded "supply not allocation" and had to RETRACT it** — see `deploys.md`
  21:0xZ correction.
- **UNFIXED, TWO:** (1) a TOTALS key names no GAME — 672 polymarket soccer quotes
  collapse to SIX distinct keys, the same class as the player-blind props;
  (2) the `842`-row builds match 0 on the COMPLETE set, never confirmed as a
  benign future-date board.
- **Deliberately NOT done:** aliasing Kalshi's `totals_q1`/`totals_h1` onto
  full-game totals.
- **SAFETY property to preserve:** the line-join fix cannot create a wrong-line
  match — those keys match NOTHING today.

### ncaaf-pace-block — OPEN, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — NCAAF calibration re-fitted and PROMOTED (15.00% -> 7.24%, impossible drives 159 -> 0); NFL deliberately NOT re-fitted (best as shipped); production read of the profile still owed — opened 2026-08-27 — session de363735
- **The NCAAF sources module WAS EDITED OUT FROM UNDER THIS LANE ON EXPLICIT
  USER OVERRIDE** `[2026-08-29, lane ncaaf-compact-card-state]`, scoped to
  `ncaaf_week_and_card_keys_for_date` ONLY -- it depended on `cfbd_lines_*.json`,
  which has no producer on any service, so NCAAF served **0 game chips on every
  service on every date**. The calibration and pace work this lane owns is
  elsewhere in that file. Module named WITHOUT a path here on purpose: this
  bullet sits above `- Files:` precisely so it cannot be read as a claim.
- Goal: the NCAAF `pace` block carries a REAL per-team seconds-per-play, so the
  engine stops running every game on the hardcoded 24.0 (`pace_index +0.400`).
  Calibration re-fitted and PROMOTED (15.00% -> 7.24%, impossible drives
  159 -> 0); NFL deliberately NOT re-fitted (best as shipped).

- **Ships DEFAULT-OFF, and that is load-bearing:** the profile was calibrated
  with `pace_index` pinned at +0.4, so turning this on is **a MECHANISM added to
  a CALIBRATED engine and owes a re-fit before any deploy**.
- **Pace is being tried because it targets a surface the model is KNOWN to get
  wrong, not because an edge is expected** — the correlation study showed these
  payload features carry NO information the market misses on margin
  (residual |r| <= 0.021, n=690).
- **Falsification test still standing:** if a re-fit with pace ON does not
  reduce TOTAL error against the market, pace is not the driver and the block
  stays off.

  across four games at once.
- Files: (none held)

  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-29 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: work is landed on `origin/main` (`eca7e81b`, verified ancestor) and the one
  remaining criterion is READ-ONLY production verification, so holding
  released: `game_chip_scoreboard.py` would block other lanes for nothing. Paths are
  named in the commit if this lane needs another code change.
  released: **NOTE for whoever takes `game_chip_scoreboard.py` next:** the guard now
  protects it for NEITHER this lane nor `wnba-chip-live-token` — see the

### mlb-resolver-write-side-effect — OPEN, **NARROWED — NOT A LIVE INCIDENT** — opened 2026-08-29 — session 6475567d-f806-45a7-880c-f633718f2411 — **UNOWNED, handed off**
- **NARROWED — NOT A LIVE INCIDENT. The falsification test this lane asked for
  HAS RUN: `should_copy` does NOT fire on the daily path in production.**
  Priority LOW. The defect is real; the blast radius is much smaller than this
  block first said.
- THE DEFECT, unchanged: `artifact_publisher._required_daily_artifact_paths` —
  which only asks WHICH artifacts are required — reaches
  `mlb.sources.daily_artifact_path` -> `_resolve_data_path_with_reconcile` ->
  `shutil.copy2` (`mlb/sources.py:116`). The copy then looks present, so
  `_missing_required_artifact_relative_paths` does not request it.
- Files: released: `syndicate/features/mlb/sources.py`,
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-31 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: `syndicate/features/shared/artifact_publisher.py`. **NOT CLAIMED.**
- Files: **NOT CLAIMED** — this lane is FINDING ONLY and changed nothing. The
  marker is moved to the FRONT of this line `[2026-08-31, lane
  soccer-shot-shrinkage]` so the PARSER agrees with what the lane already said:
  `_claimable_prefix` cuts at the first marker and keeps everything BEFORE it, so
  with the paths written first they were still being enforced as live claims, and
  the two paths it named read as contested against a lane that explicitly
  disclaims them. Nothing is taken from this lane. The paths are deliberately
  NOT repeated here: any path-like token inside a Files block becomes a CLAIM,
  which is the same trap, and writing them again would recreate it.
- **THE TRIGGER IS WORSE THAN "AN MTIME RACE", WHICH THIS BLOCK GOT WRONG.**
  `if target_stat is None: should_copy = True` — a MISSING target copies
  unconditionally, which is exactly the case the repair exists for.
- **WHY IT IS STILL NOT LIVE:** on Render the candidate root holds only
  GIT-TRACKED files and that mirror stops at 2026-07-12. Measured 2026-08-30:
  `daily_summary_2026_08_28` and `_2026_08_29` are both git-tracked=NO and both
  served 200 — production's own artifacts, no mirror involved.
- **WHAT REMAINS, and it is the part worth fixing:** any BACKFILL or EVALUATION
  over **2026-05-28 -> 2026-07-12** silently gets the git mirror's copy instead
  of production's. That is precisely the window CLAUDE.md warns backtests run
  on, so the failure mode is **a backtest that believes it read production and
  did not.**
- **A CHECK THAT PROVED NOTHING, recorded so nobody repeats it:** production's
  `daily_summary_2026_07_12.json` is byte-identical to the git copy. That is NOT
  evidence the reconcile copy won — `refresh_mlb_source_mirror.ps1` refreshes
  the mirror FROM production, so identity is expected whichever direction it
  flowed. The reading cannot discriminate the two hypotheses.
- **Discriminator if anyone wants certainty:** one `print` at `sources.py:116`
  and read a worker tick, or compare the mounted disk's mtime against deploy
  time for a tracked-window date.
- **ALSO OPEN, same family, NOT fixed:** `test_deploy_preflight.
  TooSoonVerdictTests` (6 tests) read the LIVE shared deploy claim and fail
  whenever any session holds one. **Mocking it to None made it WORSE (6 -> 8)
  and was reverted.**

### polymarket-yes-leg-binding — OPEN, **UNOWNED** `[session 5611932c ARCHIVED 2026-09-01 ~01:4xZ]` — opened 2026-08-30 — **SHIPPED + DEPLOYED; THE LEG CHOICE IS STILL UNVALIDATED; ONE LIVE-MONEY RISK OPEN AND IT IS NOT MINE TO DEPLOY**
- Goal: a Polymarket moneyline resolves its YES/NO leg from the VENUE's own
  `yesLegIndex` instead of being refused, and refuses BY NAME where the venue
  did not state it.
- **`layer2_board.py` WAS RELEASED TO ME, NOT OVERRIDDEN** `[2026-08-31]`, by
  lane `layer1-model-edge-join` (session 1c88bcca), who struck it from their own
  `Files:` block after reproducing my diagnosis independently and adding the
  decisive argument against their own work.
- **THIS PROSE SITS ABOVE THE `Files:` LINE ON PURPOSE.** `lane-guard._paths_in`
  treats ANY token containing a slash or a dot as a claimed path, and
  `_claimable_prefix` only strips text after a disclaimer marker -- so an
  explanation written INSIDE the block turns words into claims. My previous
  wording put "layer1-model-edge-join / session" in the continuation and had
  this lane claiming a bare `/`. The same cause gave 1c88bcca three phantoms
  (`1/p`, `15.0`, `85.13`) live on main for one commit, and
  `check_lane_invariants` still reported INVARIANTS HOLD because each phantom
  had exactly one holder -- so diff the claim SET, do not trust a green checker.

  `leavesQuantity` instrument cherry-picked with authorship intact; ledger
  `17a0ac2f` `13efd528` `466968e0` `69eba57f`.
- **DEPLOYED:** live-odds-worker `bf1dd290`, 20:38:53Z, fired by me, preflight
  CLEAR (the HOLD cleared on its own; no guard bypass was used or needed).
- **VERIFIED:** h2h `market_unresolved` x5 -> `would_build` at 19:54:08 with
  `yes_leg_index=0 away_index=0 agree=True`; live execution recovered after 55
  min (`EXECUTION status=ok placed=2`, 5 orders by 20:55, `BLOCKED` 0).
- **OWED — THE LEG CHOICE IS NOT VALIDATED.** Every reading is
  `yes_leg_index=0`, which IS `outcomes[0]`, so the OLD positional rule agrees
  and none of them discriminates. Needs a `yes_leg_index=1` market (4 wnba + 1
  boxing carry that shape). `agree=False` has never fired; the gate's refusal
  path is unit-tested only. NO moneyline has ever been SUBMITTED.
- **OPEN LIVE-MONEY RISK, NOT MINE, SURFACED `[2026-08-30 ~21:0xZ]`:**
  live-odds-worker runs `bf1dd290`, which CONTAINS `63661af1` (a peer's
  `never_sent` auto-reject) and does NOT contain `ef0d2d47` (their own REVERT of
  it as unsafe). Their reasoning is correct and I verified it: an order that
  FILLED after a LOST SUBMIT RESPONSE has no venue id, does not match by client
  id, and is absent from the OPEN book — exactly that branch's conditions — so
  it would be marked `rejected`, deleting a real position from the money record.
  It also ran immediately AFTER my three deliberate refusals and converted each
  into a silent write. **THE REVERT NEEDS A DEPLOY.**
  **DEPLOY ATTEMPTED AND BLOCKED `[2026-08-31 01:39-02:21Z]`.** Target
  `ef0d2d47` — the NARROW two commits past live, not tip (tip is +20 and full of
  other lanes' NCAAF work). It is READ, and TESTED at that exact SHA: 271 pass;
  the revert keeps their `stamped OR changed` persistence fix and leaves my
  three refusal paths intact; it is a descendant of live, not a rollback; and
  `3243b1c9` stays resolved because that ledger write PERSISTED, so shipping it
  does not re-open the outage. **40 consecutive preflights over 41 minutes ALL
  returned HOLD, minimum 3 jobs, never idle** — live-odds-worker is
  continuously busy in-season, unlike the 20:35Z window that let the last deploy
  through. The guard cannot be satisfied and `SYNDICATE_DEPLOY_GUARD=off` as an
  inline prefix does NOT work (it is a PreToolUse hook that reads the command
  before it runs — confirmed twice). **CLAIM RELEASED** rather than held, so it
  does not block the owning lane from shipping their own revert.
  **MEASURED EXPOSURE WHILE IT WAITS: ONE auto-reject in five hours**
  (20:39:51, the genuinely never-sent order, where the outcome was correct)
  against 98 healthy execution ticks. Real, rare, and cheap to wait on.

### layer1-model-edge-join — OPEN — opened 2026-08-30 — session 1c88bcca-be25-4164-a288-3a27d7e9dd57 — **UNOWNED, session 1c88bcca archived 2026-08-31.** Scorer released to lane `layer2-board-opportunities`, whose change is live and verified. Owed: MLB/WNBA/NCAAF coverage is UNREAD not flat — run `py -3 scripts/measure_model_edge_coverage.py` on the first build with a PREGAME slate.
- Goal: Layer 1 must join a MODEL edge on every sport/market, so Layer 2 /
  Kalshi / Polymarket rank on the sim's disagreement rather than on book hold.
- **SCOPE REQUEST GRANTED 2026-08-31 — the layer2 board scorer goes to lane
  `layer2-board-opportunities` (session 4465737c), which asked before touching
  it.** They measured the board this lane's fix produced: top 25 was 24
  `batter_home_runs` plus one totals, all 25 one-sided, top row model EV 85
  points against the best market-basis EV anywhere of about 5. Cause: model EV
  is edge divided by the fair probability, so it multiplies edge by the
  reciprocal of p and ranks a smaller edge on a longer shot above a bigger edge
  on a shorter one. I reproduced that reading myself before granting.
  **THE DECIDING ARGUMENT IS MINE AND IT IS A FLAW IN THIS LANE'S OWN WORK:**
  `blended_score` caps the model at fifteen points when it arrives as
  `model_edge`, and I routed the same information through `value_ev`, which has
  no cap at all. **Their flag must DEFAULT TO CURRENT until the user rules** —
  "price EV vs the model everywhere" is a user decision of 2026-08-30, and two
  sessions agreeing does not reverse one.
  This bullet sits ABOVE `- Files:` deliberately: prose placed inside or just
  after that block is parsed as a CLAIM, and doing it here is how this lane
  briefly claimed the tokens `1` over `p`, `15` point `0` and `85` point `13`.

- NOT CLAIMED, DELIBERATELY: `syndicate/features/shared/live_projection_join.py`
  is held by OPEN lane `live-prob-producer-reader-gap`. Imported read-only.
- STATUS: **DEPLOYED AND MEASURED** (`0fc174c6`, all three services). Seven
  defects found and fixed; soccer 2.2% -> 12.4%, nfl 27.0% -> 39.6%,
  `mfair_priced` 0 -> 3159, served top-200 rows with a model edge **1 -> 130**,
  `rows_uninformative_ev` **1269 -> 138**. EV is now priced against the model
  where a modelled fair exists (`ev_basis`), per user decision.
- **THE MODEL-EDGE WORK IS NOW MEASURED END TO END `[2026-08-31 17:00:33Z]`.**
  The scorer was released to lane `layer2-board-opportunities` on a scope
  request; their change is live on `cffbbd89` and verified: the ranking identity
  inverted exactly (`value_pct==model_ev` 50/50 -> 0/52, `==model_edge` 0/50 ->
  52/52), scores compressed 5x, top-25 market rows 3 -> 14. **The intended
  outcome is NOT achieved** — the top nine are still model-basis, best market
  row at rank 10, because edge is in probability points and market EV is in
  percent. `deploys.md` 16:48Z carries the working; the units question is
  UNSETTLED and is not this lane's to settle.
- **STILL OWED — the only reason this lane is OPEN:** MLB, WNBA and NCAAF are
  **UNREAD, NOT FLAT** (zero PREGAME games at every reading; `mfair_priced: 0`
  there is the sweep declining settled rows, not the sweep missing). WNBA's
  spread-frame fix has never fired in production — `rows_at_sim_market_line`

### mlb-live-prop-prob-merge — OPEN — opened 2026-08-31 — session 1c88bcca-be25-4164-a288-3a27d7e9dd57 — **UNOWNED, session 1c88bcca archived 2026-08-31.** Fix deployed, unverified. Owed on the first live MLB game: `snapshot_live_prob_seen > 0` and `[live_lens] LIVE_PROB_CARRIED ... carried=N`. Watch for `carried=0` with `mc_rows_with_prob>0` — a key mismatch reads as success.
- Goal: get MLB's live prop probability onto the board. The producer emits it and
  a merge threw it away. `rows_live_edged` must become non-zero on a live game.
- Files: released: syndicate/features/mlb/live_lens.py, tests/test_mlb_live_prop_prob_merge.py (new)
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-31 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
- NOT CLAIMED, DELIBERATELY: `syndicate/features/shared/live_projection_join.py`
  is held by `live-prob-producer-reader-gap`. That lane's open question — LOST IN
  THE JOIN vs NEVER PRODUCED — is ANSWERED here: **produced, then discarded**,
  which is neither of its two options.
- STATUS: **DEPLOYED (`0fc174c6`) AND UNVERIFIED.** `_carry_live_probability`
  stamps the MC row's `liveModelProbOver` onto the matching card row before the
  cards set replaces the MC set, keyed with `live_projection_join`'s own rule
  (imported, not re-derived). Producer emitted up to 27 rows against a published
  `with_live_prob` of **0**. Loop health confirmed on the new code.
- CONSTRAINTS THAT SURVIVE THIS LANE: (1) `#414` — price `liveModelProbOver` and
  NOTHING else; the `modelProbOver` fallback was shipped and BACKED OUT, do not
  reintroduce it. (2) `#124 follow-up (a)` — cards stay the primary ROW source;
  carry the probability ONTO them. (3) live PROP skill has never been measured;
  publishing an edge is not a claim that it is safe to bet.
- **VERIFICATION OWED — FIRST LIVE MLB GAME.** `snapshot_live_prob_seen > 0` and
  `rows_live_edged > 0` from `per_sport_ingest.mlb.enrichment.live_projections`,
  plus `[live_lens] LIVE_PROB_CARRIED gamePk=... carried=N` on refresh-worker.
  **Watch for `carried=0` with `mc_rows_with_prob>0`** — a key mismatch, which
  reads as success rather than as a crash. On a finished slate the line's
  absence is evidence of NOTHING.

### layer2-cap-raise — OPEN, **UNOWNED** `[session 5611932c ARCHIVED 2026-09-01 ~01:4xZ]` — opened 2026-08-31 — **GOAL MET; ALL THREE INCIDENT DEFECTS CLOSED + VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION. ONE THING OWED: the 2000-cap raise is STAGED AND UNVERIFIED.**
- Goal: board carries >400 rows for a sport. **MET** at 1000 (932 → 1634 rows, no sport lost).
- Files: released: `pipeline/intelligence_state.py` **[claim REASSIGNED from `polymarket-yes-leg-binding`, same session]**; Render ENV on refresh-worker via the single-key API — never `render.yaml`. **NOW ALSO CLAIMS CODE:** `pipeline/intelligence_state.py`, `tests/test_layer2_shard_index_stale.py`, `tests/test_layer2_cards_shards.py`, `tests/test_shortlist_persist_ceiling_guard.py` — the last MOVED here from `polymarket-yes-leg-binding`, which had misfiled it. Same session owns both lanes; the file is the layer2 size instrument, not a venue file.
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-31 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
- Env live: `ROWS_PER_SPORT=1000`, `ROWS_TOTAL=3000`, `COMBINED_ROWS=0` (refresh-worker only; other two services clean).
- **DO NOT RAISE THE CAP AGAIN AS A CONFIG CHANGE.** The ceiling is the COMBINED key (~2,200 B/row even with `rows: []`) ⇒ ~3,600 TOTAL rows. Shard headroom is not evidence about it.
- **NEXT ACTION (owed, for whoever picks this up): the 2000/sport cap and ROWS_TOTAL=6000 are STAGED on refresh-worker but UNDEPLOYED, and the 75% warn threshold `c461693e` is on main and undeployed. Both ride the next refresh-worker deploy. They are UNTESTABLE until a full multi-sport slate — tonight the board is MLB-ONLY at ~547 rows, below even the old 1000 cap. VERIFY BY: a sport actually reaching >1000 rows; if none does, the raise stays untested however long it sits deployed.** Measured safe against REAL production rows (combined 220 B, worst shard 50.6–55.2%). Two caveats: the percentage is SLATE-DEPENDENT, and 3000/sport reads 74.6% — under the 75% line, so the warning is NOT a guard against a 3000 raise. REVERT of the cards flip remains one step: `SYNDICATE_LAYER2_CARDS_INLINE=1` + redeploy.
### polymarket-pregame-price-gate — OPEN, **UNOWNED** [ownership sweep 2026-08-31: owning session gone, no live session on this machine] — opened 2026-08-31 — session 6475567d-f806-45a7-880c-f633718f2411
- Rationale: opened retroactively at the midday checkpoint; the two earlier
  deploys that day went out under the holder `ncaaf-totals-dispersion`, a BLOCKED
  NCAAF lane. Later deploys used this name. The engine files
  (`pipeline/execute_portfolio.py`, `syndicate/features/shared/polymarket_board_join.py`)
  are claimed by `polymarket-yes-leg-binding` and are DELIBERATELY NOT listed
  below: every edit was cross-lane with explicit user authorisation, and claiming
  them here contests a lane that owns them.
- Goal: a Polymarket order buys the side we chose, at a price the venue receives,
  or it is refused by name.
- Files: released: tests/test_execute_portfolio.py, tests/test_polymarket_board_join.py
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-31 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
- Hypothesis: pregame only CHEAP sides fill; once live everything fills.
- Falsification test: an explored order filling above 0.410 PREGAME. NEITHER
  probe did — pregame half SOLID (2 probes, 2 sports, ~20 reads each, 0 fills).
  LIVE half NOT replicating: `ast-ars` filled kick+17m47s, `bal-col` still
  resting at pitch+35m. The rule is PARTLY confirmed; see state.md.
- Verification: DONE — submit-price gate (`submit_price=` 15:53:26Z), band edge
  (`EXPLORE ... 0.450` 16:03:16Z), EV stamping (6/6 positive, 17:32Z), fill rule
  (`avgPx=0.4500 lastTransact=19:20:09Z`), wrong-side fix deployed both services
  (live-odds-worker d04d9f49 21:02:07Z, refresh-worker 8876b823 21:20:36Z, no
  regression 21:06Z). NOT DONE — the POSITIVE soccer case: no soccer h2h has
  resolved since the fix, so a CORRECT leg being selected has never been observed.
- Blocked by: none
- OPEN, NOT FIXABLE BY DEPLOY: `atc-sea-ata-bol` is a live position on the WRONG
  side (Bologna, not Atalanta). Manual close on the venue.
- NO WATCHER RUNNING. `btb81lzt8` died with the session at ~01:2xZ; reads from
  pitch+40m to +80m were never captured. Re-read `ORDER_STATE` for
  `aec-mlb-bal-col-2026-08-31` directly; do not assume a reading is coming.
- `gameStartTime` is ABSENT on all 10 `bal-col` slate rows, so liveness cannot be
  confirmed from the venue — only from the board's `commence_time`.

### soccer-shot-shrinkage — CLOSED 2026-09-02 — opened 2026-08-31 — session 1c88bcca-be25-4164-a288-3a27d7e9dd57 — **UNOWNED. GOAL MET 2026-09-01 — the divisor IS live in the engine, MEASURED, and `todo.md #612` is CLOSED.** Discharged not on the board but on the PREDICTION ARCHIVE the engine writes: self-normalised over the 3,434 players present both sides of the 2026-08-31 ship date, median post/pre `expected_shots` **0.720** against a predicted 1/1.3979 = **0.715**, with `expected_minutes_share` flat at **1.000** so the step cannot be "future fixtures carry fewer minutes". Tool `scripts/check_soccer_divisor_reached_engine.py`. Monthly re-fit ran the same day: **1.3979 -> 1.3930**, published and read back, no deploy. Residual (small): `players_*.csv` is not in `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS`, so the board-render form of the reading still cannot run from web. Detail in `.syndicate/deploys.md` 2026-09-01 15:0xZ. **CLOSED 2026-09-02:** goal met and measured; monthly re-fit automated as scheduled task `refit-soccer-shot-shrinkage`; re-checked one day on — the new dated file did not break resolution (shots/minute 0.726 vs 1.00-if-absent, n=3,428). The ONE residual is carried as `todo.md #636`, not by this lane.
- Goal: the soccer shots model stops over-predicting by ~1.4x. Ship the
  held-out-validated divisor as a DISK-BACKED, RE-FITTABLE calibration artifact,
  never a hard-coded constant. Testable: the served board's shot-prop
  probabilities fall, and `expected_shots` bias on the next backtest run moves
  toward 0 from +0.166.
- Files: released: syndicate/features/soccer/sim_engine/soccersim/player_props.py
  **CLAIMS RELEASED 2026-08-31 — phantom sweep, the owning session is gone. The paths in this block are a RECORD, not a claim. A lane that resumes this work reclaims them by striking this note and the `released:` tokens.**
  released: syndicate/features/soccer/sim_engine/soccersim/shot_calibration.py
  released: syndicate/features/shared/artifact_publisher.py
  released: scripts/fit_soccer_shot_shrinkage.py
  released: tests/test_soccer_shot_shrinkage.py
- Evidence this rests on (all in `state.md [soccer-shots-prop-skill]`): n=9,840
  pairs / 247 matches / 9 leagues from production; ratio 1.398; held-out SCALAR
  MAE 0.5551 vs raw 0.6251 vs baseline 0.6278; SCALAR beats AFFINE in all 9
  leagues and all 4 splits. On-target RATE is already correct (model 0.345 vs
  actual 0.342, ratio 1.007), so one divisor at the `expected_shots` choke point
  fixes shots AND shots-on-target without a second constant.
- Hypothesis: correcting the MEAN is sufficient; the Poisson FORM needs no change
  (dispersion 1.07, P(>=2) bias -0.0001 over 597 players / 759 matches).
- Falsification test: if the served shot-prop probabilities do not fall after
  deploy, the artifact is not reaching the engine and the change is INERT --
  which is this repo's most common failure and the reason for the reachability
  test below.
- Verification: reachability FIRST (divisor 1.0 vs 1.4 produce different
  probabilities, driving the real shipped function), then a PRODUCTION read of
  the served board, then a re-run of
  `scripts/backtest_soccer_shot_props_production.py` on dates AFTER the deploy.
- SAFETY: absent/unreadable/out-of-range artifact -> divisor 1.0, i.e. exactly
  today's behaviour. Clamped to [1.0, 2.0] so a corrupt fit cannot zero the board.
- STATUS: **SHIPPED TO ALL THREE SERVICES, NOT YET OBSERVED WORKING.** web
  `132559e1` (allowlist), both workers `a35591dc` (wiring + dated resolver), all
  content-verified on the deployed blob. Artifact published 200 and READ BACK:
  `divisor=1.3979, n=9840, matches=247`. Divisor measured at 1.398x
  over-prediction; a SCALAR beat an AFFINE fit held out in all 9 leagues and all
  4 date splits.
- **THE VERIFICATION IS OWED AND CANNOT BE FORCED.** At publish time the board
  carried ZERO soccer shot-prop rows, and the soccer sim runs every FOUR HOURS
  (`SYNDICATE_SOCCER_PREGAME_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=14400`). **Nothing is
  confirmed to have reached live-odds-worker.** The closing reading is
  composition-invariant: implied Poisson mean divided by that player's own
  season `shots_per90`, which was **1.19** before and must land near **0.85**.
  A median still near 1.19 WITH rows present means the artifact reached web but
  not the worker — that is the failure mode, not absence of rows.
- Blocked by: none. The soccer engine was unclaimed at open (verified with
  `lane_claim_audit.py`).

### layer2-accuracy-audit — OPEN, UNOWNED, SESSION ARCHIVED 2026-08-31 ~23:5xZ — **CLAIMS: NONE HELD, all four services free.** Handoff armed: scheduled task `check-mlb-pregame-freeze-611` fires 2026-09-01 08:30 CT (needs a manual Run-now for tool approval). **`#611`'s deployed log line is UNREADABLE — do not plan around it; read the artifact + run history instead.** 7-day board accuracy DELIVERED; MLB game-line join FIXED, DEPLOYED and VERIFIED (`13 -> 0` misses, `(pregame-freeze, 14 games)`, 20:33:17Z) — but it did NOT raise graded rows, which falsified my own causal claim.

- Hypothesis: Layer 2 accuracy is NOT measurable end-to-end today. Specifically (a) shortlist artifacts are retained only ~4 days, not 7; (b) the evaluation ledger settles 0.2% of settleable records because the GRADED-ROW SUPPLY is near-zero (mlb=1/day vs a documented ~700-2400), not because the matcher is broken; (c) NCAAF, the largest board sport by row count, has no grader at all.
- Falsification test: if `graded_rows_for_date('mlb', d)` returns hundreds of rows in production for a recent finished date, (b) is wrong and the defect is in the matcher. If dated shortlist artifacts exist for 2026-08-25..27 under any other read path, (a) is wrong.
- Verification: a written per-sport/per-bet-type table with denominators, or an explicit statement of which cells are unmeasurable and why, each backed by a production reading recorded here.
- Blocked by: none. Adjacent, not conflicting: `ncaaf-settlement-resolver` (764eca35) touches NCAAF settlement — will notify rather than edit.

**FINDINGS 2026-08-31 ~17:5xZ — hypothesis CONFIRMED on all three limbs, and the headline is a different number than the one I went looking for.**

**The measurable answer exists after all, and it is NOT the evaluation ledger.** The paper/live PORTFOLIO book is committed straight off `read_layer2_shortlist` (`pipeline/portfolio_commit.py:357`), so `/api/portfolio/paper?date=` and `/api/portfolio/live` ARE a Layer 2 accuracy surface. 7 days, 2026-08-24..08-30:

- **PAPER (our own grading, `settled_by=inferred` on 402/402): 47.9% win, +9.4% ROI, +$156.32 / $1,656.80 staked.**
- **LIVE (real money, kalshi+polymarket, 239 settled): 42.3% win, −5.5% ROI, −$40.31 / $733.31 staked.**
- Controlled-ish per venue: `paper:kalshi` **+1.1%** (364 settled) vs LIVE kalshi **−7.6%** (159 orders); `paper:polymarket` **+28.5%** (165) vs LIVE polymarket **−1.3%** (83). Same sign both times; bet sets are NOT identical (venue availability + gate/fill), so this is a flag, not an attribution.
- The ledger already carried this shape once: 2026-08-26, venue 3 bets −11.88% vs inferred 12 bets +51.07% (`paper_settlement.py:1224`).

By bet type (paper, 7d): game_line 56.7% / **+25.3% ROI [95% CI +7.2..+43.4]**, n=141 — the ONLY bucket whose CI excludes zero. game_total 47.5% / +9.8% [−9.3..+29.0] n=141. player_prop 37.8% / **−13.5%** [−33.5..+6.5] n=119. Real money inverts game_line: h2h+spreads 12W/23L = 34.3%, −23.9%.

By sport (paper, 7d): mlb 375 settled (94%), wnba 22, soccer 5, ncaaf **0**, nfl 0. Real money: mlb −6.8% (182), wnba +3.3% (31), nfl −4.1% (18), soccer −23.2% (8), ncaaf 0.

**Limb (a) CONFIRMED** — `/api/board/layer2-shortlist` returns `no_shortlist_artifact` for 08-25/26/27; only 08-28..08-31 exist. 4 dated snapshots, 2,623 rows.
**[CORRECTED 2026-08-31 ~18:2xZ] The MLB join cause is NARROWED BY CONTENT, and my first mechanism was wrong.** Read both `daily/snapshots` copies for 08-30: the pregame freeze holds **all 14 games**, names matching the warning strings verbatim, including CIN@CHC — the one game that DID grade. The live copy holds **0 games** (`retrieved_at` 08-31T04:52Z, post-slate). The builder graded 1 and warned 13, so it read a THIRD copy holding exactly one game, necessarily under `market/oddsapi/` — the tree `_odds_paths` resolves and the export endpoint cannot see. That is the **2026-08-16** failure shape (freeze written where the reader does not look; `refresh_mlb_oddsapi.py:646`), not the `_odds_paths` root-loop break I named first. **This is the THIRD occurrence of this symptom with the THIRD candidate cause — do not assume either prior fix.** Still not proven; needs a disk read of `market/oddsapi/`.

**Limb (b) CONFIRMED, and the cause is upstream of the matcher.** Settlement: 19,692 settleable, 35 settled (0.2%). `graded_rows_available` mlb = 1,2,1,1,1,7,0 per day. Independently reproduced on the WEB service from a different code path: `/mlb/api/market-accuracy?date=` returns `rows.all` = 1, 1, 7 for 08-28/29/30, with **12, 12, 13 `Missing game-line match for <game>` warnings** — i.e. ~1 of 13-14 MLB games joins. This is the SAME symptom `build_season_betting_cards_manifest.py:757` says was measured and fixed on 2026-08-07 ("13 of 14 games lost, one graded row for the whole day"). The sealed pregame freeze IS present and full-slate (`oddsapi_game_lines_2026_08_30_pregame.json` 76,872B vs live 1,105B), so the freeze is not the missing piece — `_odds_paths` breaks out of its ROOT loop on the first root that has EITHER file, so a root holding only the thin live copy wins over a later root holding the freeze. NOT VERIFIED — I could not read `market/oddsapi/` (not in `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS`, so `artifacts/export` is blind to it; absence there is NOT absence on disk).
**Limb (c) CONFIRMED** — ncaaf grader reads `cfbd_lines_*.json`; 0 such files in the hot-artifact set; 0 graded rows; 0 orders ever.

**The funnel, which is the real optimization target.** Refusals 08-24..08-31: **`no_model_edge_pct` 2,506**, `below_min_ev_pct` 1,567, below_min_stake 46, zero_kelly 37 — ~4,150 refusals against ~425 orders. Board-side this reconciles exactly: **`model_edge_pct` is numeric on only 902 of 2,623 rows (34.4%)**; `model_ev_pct` numeric on 201. `ev_basis` = market_fair 1,451 / model_edge 184 / model_probability 17 / unset 971. `model_skill.status`: measured 625, unmeasured 882, no projection block 1,116.
Quote quality: **books_quoting <= 1 on 1,511 rows (57.6%)**; book_age median 4,498s, p90 36,816s, 21.3% over 6h, 8.8% `suspect_stale`; movement not tracked 42.1%. ev_pct > 0 on only 444 rows (16.9%), median −2.35%.

**Corrected mid-audit:** I first read per-market medians of `model_edge_pct` as 0.00 and nearly reported "no model edge on 1,609 rows". The field is NULL on those rows, not zero — 0 rows carry a numeric 0.00. Same conclusion, different mechanism, and the wrong one would have sent the fix at the wrong function.

**NOT MEASURED, and it is the thing I most wanted:** whether the board's own `ev_pct`/`model_edge_pct`/`score` PREDICT the outcome. The portfolio endpoints expose settlement marginals only (`by_sport`, `by_market_family`, `by_venue_family`), not per-order rows, so no edge-bucket calibration curve was computed. That needs the refresh-worker-side order ledger.

- **OWED LIST RE-READ AGAINST THE SYSTEM `[2026-09-01, lane game-market-entry-roi-curve]`. Of the three, ONE IS DISCHARGED, ONE IS BOUNDED, ONE IS GENUINELY BLOCKED. The header's "ONE DEPLOY OWED" was STALE.**
  **(c) DISCHARGED — `refresh_nba_oddsapi_props`'s inversion is READ AND CLEAR.** It is not merely sharing the chokepoint; it carries the whole ported fix. Identical `_CERTAINTY_FLOOR/CEILING = 0.01, 0.99`, identical `certainty_clamped` counter, identical `_plausible_ev_pct` at `_MAX_PLAUSIBLE_EV_PCT = 100.0`, and at `refresh_nba_oddsapi_props.py:1246` the corrected `implied_prob * (1.0 + (ev or 0.0))` under a comment that names the source: *"THE INVERSION WAS DIMENSIONALLY WRONG (ported fix, WNBA `bef61c33`) ... EV per unit staked is q/p - 1, so the inversion is q = p * (1 + ev), NOT p + ev."* Dimensions check: `ev` is a fraction there (`ev_pct = ev * 100.0` one line above), so the expression is sound. **Nothing owed.**
  **(b) BOUNDED, NOT MEASURED, and it is NOT slate-blocked.** `_run_wnba_postgame_producer_tick` **is running now** — `WNBA_POSTGAME_PRODUCER` hourly at 19:08 / 20:09 / 21:10Z on 2026-09-01, backfilling 2026-08-16 / 08-15 / 08-14 with `boxscores rows 63 / 55 / 41 status=ok`. So its cost is measurable today rather than on 09-17. **The bound: refresh-worker shows `server_failed = 0` across 26 `deploy_ended` events, 2026-08-31T15:10Z..09-02T00:48Z** — the tick has not destabilised the worker. **That is evidence it is not fatal and is NOT a measurement of its cost**; container headroom cannot supply one (page-cache confound, `state.md [memory.current is page cache]`). Still owed as a real reading.
  **(a) GENUINELY BLOCKED until 2026-09-17**, exactly as written — the fields are baked into `recommendations_slate_*.json` and WNBA does not rebuild until the sprint. Carried by `#623`. Nothing to do before then.
  **DEPLOY: NONE OWED.** Web is live on `dd049490`, and both `417e19ed` and `07cb592a` are ancestors of it. The header said otherwise and was wrong.
  **ADJACENT — CHARACTERISED 2026-09-01 AND BENIGN, no action:** those 3 `live-odds-worker` `server_failed` events are `reason.earlyExit` because the worker **recycles itself every 6 hours on purpose** (`SYNDICATE_LIVE_ODDS_WORKER_MAX_UPTIME_SECONDS` default 21600; observed uptimes 22,712s and 23,606s, and its own `RECYCLING ... to reset accumulated page cache` line with `stage: before_exit`). Render labels a voluntary exit `server_failed`. **Not a defect, nothing owed.** Rule in `learnings.md`. Original note kept below:
  **ADJACENT, UNOWNED, UNCHARACTERISED — not this lane's and not filed:** `live-odds-worker` shows **3 `server_failed` in the same window, all `reason.earlyExit` (not oomKilled, not evicted)** — 2026-08-31T12:30Z, 09-01T09:53Z, 09-01T22:03Z. Could be a clean finish or a crash-loop; **the reason field does not say and I did not characterise it.** Distinct from `#632`, which is web and OOM.
- **OWED / NOT VERIFIED:** (a) T0-2, the T2-3 producer clamp and the `p*(1+ev)` inversion are **deployed but NOT IN FORCE** — those fields are baked into `recommendations_slate_*.json` and WNBA does not rebuild until **2026-09-17**; unit-verified only. (b) `_run_wnba_postgame_producer_tick`'s memory cost is REASONED, not measured (refresh-worker headroom read 96.8MB at 14:23Z). (c) `refresh_nba_oddsapi_props` shares the `_clamp_probability` chokepoint — its inversion is UNREAD, not cleared.
- Blocked on a live slate (2026-09-17): T0-1, T0-3, T1-5, T2-1, T2-2, T3-1..T3-5, T4-1/3/4. `todo #614`–`#617` carry the findings; **`#614` and `#616` were CORRECTED in place** after I named mechanisms from symptoms.
- **2026-09-01 EXCHANGE PRICES — VERIFIED.** `kept_direct=603` on the first grid build after the first Kalshi capture (`0` on every build before it); second capture +153; both post-capture builds agree. The provenance stamp and the grid rule that honours it are mine, the capture is `syndicate-e2`'s. Re-derived off Render by me, not taken from their report. Evidence in `deploys.md`.
- **The `near_misses` defect they reported in this file is FIXED — `07cb592a`.** It was my regression: provenance-based dropping created a second class of survivor and the counter's precondition assumed one. Moved under `else`. **Their suggested `continue` is a SILENT REVERT** — `freshest[key]`/`anchors[]` follow that block, so it deletes the kept row from the grid; measured (`assert 'kalshi' in {'fanduel'}`). Do not apply it.
- **DEPLOYED `417e19ed`, live 16:55:23Z. Both gates read.** `near_misses` gate **MET**: `kept_direct=603 near_misses={'kalshi': 603}` → `kept_direct=830 near_misses={}` (kept GREW while the false alarm went empty, so the counter was fixed rather than the rows suppressed). Polymarket gate **NOT MET**: `POLYMARKET_QUOTE_CAPTURE matches=60 sports=['mlb','soccer'] appended=0` — the capture is reachable and correctly wired, and wrote nothing because all 60 were GAME markets and the builder is props-only **by design**. **CORRECTED 2026-09-01 (chip session dee09146, deploys.md `c587010a`): matches can ONLY ever be game markets — the join refuses every PROP type (`polymarket_board_join.py:1329`, "PROP is fetched every cycle and thrown away"), so `appended > 0` is UNREACHABLE on `417e19ed` by construction, not pending a slate. Do not leave a watcher on this gate.** **Do not remove that bound to make the number rise** — OddsAPI already writes `polymarket` game rows under the same dedup key, so a second writer alternates rather than adds.
- **ALL FILES RELEASED, including `book_grid.py` — nothing here is claimed.** The near-miss counter fix is DONE and live (`07cb592a` in `417e19ed`); `kept_direct=869 near_misses={}` at 17:06:46Z. **A chip session was scoped on the pre-deploy symptom (`near_misses=603`) and on adding `continue` after `kept_direct_feed += 1` — DO NOT DO THAT.** `instance` / `freshest[key]` / `anchors[]` follow that block, so `continue` skips the kept row's registration and it never reaches the grid: measured `assert 'kalshi' in {'fanduel'}`. It presents as a perfect reading with zero exchange prices on the board. The shipped fix is `else`. `tests/test_direct_feed_provenance.py` pins both sides and will catch it.
- **Honest state of "exchange prices on the board":** Kalshi direct — YES, proven (830). Polymarket game — already arrived via OddsAPI, untouched. Polymarket direct — contributes nothing, and **CANNOT until the JOIN is changed**. CORRECTED 2026-09-01 (found by `syndicate-21`, verified by me on the code): `polymarket_board_join.py` refuses every unmapped type incl. PROP (`market_type_not_a_game_line`), so it emits game lines only and never sets `player_name`, while my builder consumes only rows WITH `player_name` — **empty intersection by construction**. Polymarket lists thousands of props; the join discards them. My earlier "fires on its own, nothing further needed" was wrong and would have left someone watching a gate that can never pass. The join-side fix is NOT "allow PROP": that bucket is MIXED (LoL map winners measured inside it), so characterise it first. Chip `task_4889e312` owns this; it needs `polymarket_board_join.py`, listed by `open-bet-live-status` (UNOWNED).
- **Traceability gap, both venues, by choice:** `venue_ticker` persisted on 0 of 603 rows (`_normalize` keeps a fixed key set). Removed from my builder; a boundary test now asserts EVERY builder's keys survive `_normalize`. One-line fix (`venue_ticker` into `_normalize`) written down and deliberately not taken — a shared-schema change that would leave one venue traceable and the other not.
- Blocked by: none. Next: **`#623`** (the 09-17 sprint + pre-registered gates + parked `#614`/`#616` reads) and **`#626`(d)(e)** (reuse-guard/live-capture, klass-hole). **`#622`** owns the ranking-key question — per `#615` T2-1 is ANSWERED (no sim-derived key exists; do NOT keep re-looking at the 656-row sample, ~30 looks are already on record). `scripts/prereg_wnba_favourite_lean.py` is frozen and waiting for the sprint.



### ncaaf-games-cache-refresh — OPEN — opened 2026-09-01 — session b85e895e-dde2-4066-8336-dc6c1d4c3c61 — **DEPLOYED `cc1feccc` to BOTH services (web 21:21:43Z, refresh-worker 21:56:06Z). Web half VERIFIED discriminatingly (200 vs 403 allowlist probe). Producer half LIVE BUT UNPROVEN — the daily gate does not fire until ~00:26Z. Two verifications ARMED as scheduled tasks.**
- Goal: `ncaaf_target_week` returns the real current week instead of a permanent
  1, on BOTH services, without web ever calling CFBD.
- THE DEFECT: `ensure_games_cached` returns early on `path.exists()`, so
  `games_2026.json.gz` (written 2026-07-21, one commit `5da1dd21`) was never
  re-fetched. 888 games, `completed: False` on **888 of 888**, so
  `min(week with an unplayed game)` is 1 forever.
  `/ncaaf/api/cards?week=2` and `?week=3` both served `"2026 Week 1"` with nav
  `next=prev="1"`; ops `season-weeks` reported artifacts for weeks [1-13, 15]
  and `resolved_active_weeks: [1]`.
- NOT WRONG YET, COMES DUE 2026-09-08: week 1 spans 08-29..09-07, so target=1 is
  correct today by accident. Week 2 kicks off 09-11. Verified against the real
  file that an honest refresh does NOT advance the week early (8 games past
  kickoff, matching the board's own `Final: 8` from a different code path).
- NOT the cause of the 0-NCAAF-orders gap — the Layer 2 / book-grid path
  resolves the week from the schedule BY DATE
  (`game_projections.py::load_ncaaf_game_projections`) and bypasses this gate.
  That gap is `edge_vs_market_pct = None` on all three NCAAF markets, deliberate
  and documented in `ncaaf/game_projections.py`.

  so there is no alternative route. Committed on the session branch only.

- **CROSS-LANE, AUTHORISED AND LOGGED. NOT CLAIMED HERE ON PURPOSE:**
  `artifact_publisher.py` **WAS** claimed by OPEN lane
  `football-projection-publish-allowlist` (`#618`), and the claim STAYS THERE —
  my edit is finished and landed, so holding a second claim would only block
  that lane for no benefit. **`[2026-09-01, ownership pass: THAT LANE IS NOW
  CLOSED — goal met and verified on the served artifact — and its block moved to
  `lanes_history.md`. `artifact_publisher.py` is therefore claimed by NOBODY and
  is FREE TO TAKE. This bullet's deference no longer points at anything; it is
  kept because it records why this lane chose not to claim, not because the
  other lane still exists.]`** It is listed in this bullet rather than in `Files:`
  for exactly that reason; the edit is recorded, the lock is not taken. **USER OVERRIDE
  2026-09-01: "go ahead and land it, the allowlist edit is additive."** It is
  one pattern plus its note, appended after that lane's two entries; both of
  theirs verified intact on origin/main after the rebase, and THEIR OWN test
  (`tests/test_football_projection_publish_allowlist.py`) passes against the
  landed tree. No alternative route existed — the allowlist is the only
  mechanism that can permit the transfer.
- TWO CONSTRAINTS THAT SHAPED THE FIX, both measured:
  (a) this loader's `_cfbd_get` is raw urllib with NO `cfbd_backoff` and NO
  `cfbd_quota_latch` — a refresh added naively here rebuilds the hourly hammer
  `ncaaf-cfbd-quota-latch` shipped to stop, on a path the latch cannot see.
  (b) the refreshed cache CANNOT reach web: `publish_hot_artifact` reads
  sub-4MB files as UTF-8 text, so the 39KB `.gz` raises UnicodeDecodeError ->
  `SKIP_READ_FAILED`. Hence a small owned JSON artifact (`week_state.py`)
  rather than a web-side CFBD call: web reads counts the worker derived.
- Verification: DONE LOCALLY. 276 tests green (153 ncaaf + 123 publisher), no
  regressions. Covers off!=on for the refresh, the artifact WINNING over the
  stale cache (order, not just parsing), the fallback when no artifact exists,
  `ncaaf_target_week` never reaching CFBD, and the written path being one
  `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS` actually matches — that last is the half that was
  inert for 13 days on the sibling entry.
- ~~**OWED: no production reading. NOT DEPLOYED, NOT PUSHED.**~~ **PAID
  2026-09-01 21:05-21:15 CDT (scheduled verification run). THE FIX IS PROVEN
  IN PRODUCTION.** Full measurement: `deploys.md` -> `## 2026-09-02 --
  refresh-worker/web cc1feccc -- NCAAF week_state producer`.
  - Shipped as `bc2365fc` + `c1c3cf12` -> `cc1feccc` (this block's `cf41d1a9` /
    `5a88f20b` are the PRE-REBASE session-branch SHAs; the landed pair differs).
    Both services have since moved on -- refresh-worker `ad1de331`, web
    `dd049490` -- and all three SHAs are ancestors of BOTH, so the fix is on
    what is actually running (checked by ancestry, not assumed).
  - Producer ran: `SEASON_PROJECTION_LAUNCHING sport=ncaaf ... reason=artifact_stale
    age_seconds=86537` at 19:35:41 CDT. Daily gate fired as predicted.
  - **DECISIVE: the artifact crossed to web.** `/api/ops/artifacts/export` ->
    HTTP 200 `count:1`, `stale_completion_flags 0`, **week 1 completed 8 /
    unplayed 91** against the write-once file's **0 of 888** (re-verified on the
    2026-07-21 copy today). Allowlist CONTROL returned 403, so the 200 counts.
    8 is corroborated by the kickoff distribution -- only 8 week-1 games had
    kicked off (7 on 08-29, 1 on 08-30, none until 09-03).
  - `resolved_active_weeks [1]` -- CORRECT today, not a regression; week 1 runs
    08-29..09-07. The advance remains the 2026-09-08 check.
- **INSTRUMENT DEFECT FOUND, NOT FIXED (read-only run):** the prescribed log
  readings `GAMES_CACHE_REFRESH` / `WEEK_STATE` CANNOT EVER REACH Render.
  `log()` at `scripts/generate_smartsim2_ncaaf_projections.py:796` writes only to
  the `--progress-log` FILE, never stdout -- so every `log(...)` in that script is
  invisible to the collector. A `BOARD_HEALTH sport=ncaaf` control over the same
  window returned 24 hits, so the logs API was healthy and the absence is the
  emitter's. Fix would be one `print(message, flush=True)`; nothing else in the
  lane depends on it. **The lane's own stated proof was unattainable by
  construction** -- the artifact read replaced it.
- Commits (session branch `session/ncaaf-games-cache-refresh`, LANDED as
  `bc2365fc` + `c1c3cf12`): `cf41d1a9` refresh producer, `5a88f20b` week-state
  artifact.
- Blocked by: none (the contested file needs a decision, not a blocker).

### book-quotes-publish-clobber — OPEN (guard LANDED `51cf8b83`; capture fix LANDED `e78aee52` by another session; **`#630` todo item still OWED** — NO LONGER BLOCKED, `todo.md` released 2026-09-01 and the `#624` step 6 caveat applied, see the annotation below) — opened 2026-09-01 — session 3492626c — **HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: `book_quotes` daily shards LOSE ROWS. Two services each publish a WHOLE-FILE REPLACE of the same file; web keeps whoever published last.** Refetch lost 1,318 exchange rows / gained 0, clean tail truncation, while sportsbook gained a whole hour. **76% of `#624` step 6's 1,795 'no time-aligned quote' exclusions are this defect, not market liquidity** — a published caveat was wrong and is corrected.
- **OWNER CORRECTED 2026-09-01 by the ownership pass (lane `game-market-entry-roi-curve`): the recorded session `3492626c` DOES NOT EXIST in a 200-session roster spanning 2026-08-13..09-02, yet this lane was worked TODAY.** The live worker is **`local_ea1e4863`** — the only running session on this machine, and the one that messaged me describing this lane's work (the clobber, `feed_overlap`, the `#630` item, the `todo.md` block). Circumstantial but strong; stated as an inference, not a lookup. **This lane is the counterexample that stopped the pass from closing anything on ownership grounds.**
- **THE SAME-INSTANT READ YOU AND I BOTH OWED IS TAKEN `[2026-09-02 14:19Z]`, and your plateau was a WINDOW, not a ceiling.** `unreclaimable` = `anon` + **4.7-5.4 MB (0.4-0.5%)** on every one of 15 samples — they are the same quantity, because `container_memory_payload` builds both from ONE `memory.stat` read, so any `CONTAINER_MEMORY` line is already same-instant. **Our numbers are directly comparable; subtract ~5 MB from yours.** Web has been up since 05:24:25Z with no restart, and anon went **906.6 → 1,163.7 MB over 8.0h = +32.0 MB/h**, now **57% of 2,048**. Your 861.8-894.9 band matches **06:00-09:00Z exactly** — real for that window, and the climb resumed after it. **And it corrects ME too: anon DOES fall without a restart** (—57 MB between 12:17 and 13:16Z), so my "never falls except at a restart" was wrong. At +32 MB/h, OOM #1's 1,637 MB is ~23h of uptime away — which deploys normally pre-empt. In `#632`.
- **ANSWER TO YOUR 2026-09-02 QUESTION — "how did the deploy get through?" `[from lane game-market-entry-roi-curve; your session is not reachable in the messaging roster, so it is here]`.** **`web` and `syndicate` are TWO LOCKS FOR ONE SERVICE and I took the other one.** No `--force`, no `SYNDICATE_DEPLOY_GUARD=off`, and I DID run the claim step: `acquire --service syndicate` — GRANTED, while you held `web`. `deploy_claim.py:69` keys the lock by NAME STRING (`_path = CLAIM_DIR / f"{service}.json"`), so the two files are independent. **The three tools disagree:** `deploy_preflight.py:95` aliases both names to `srv-d88ahvrbc2fs73eodu30`; `deploy-guard.py:104` maps that id to **`web` only**; `deploy_claim.py` aliases nothing. Filed as **`#635`** with the fix (key the claim on the Render service ID, or stop offering `syndicate`).
  **The human half is mine.** My own `status` printed `web HELD by book-quotes-publish-clobber` and `syndicate free` and I read it as two services; preflight even printed `web ... <-- deploying` while I held `syndicate`, and I did not stop on the mismatch.
  **WHAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN, and did not invent a cause for:** why the GUARD did not also refuse. It is armed, its regex matches the URL shape I used, and it resolves the id to `web` — which you held. **I reproduced it blocking an equivalent command today.** Its silence at 05:03Z is unaccounted for; if the hook keeps a decision log, that is where it is. Recorded as a SECOND hole in `#635`, explicitly not assumed to be the same bug.
  **Sorry for the cancelled build.** Your containment check was the right instinct and I have recorded that it held by luck, not by design.
- **YOUR MEMORY WATCH CORRECTED MY `#632` NUMBER, and I would rather take it from you than keep publishing it.** I reported anon **270.8 → 759.5 MB in 7m23s** as leak growth. **Both readings sit inside the first 12 minutes after my own deploy's restart.** Your plateau — unreclaimable to ~895 MB then oscillating **861.8-894.9 for 50 min, never crossing 900** — says that is one curve: a ramp to a **~890 MB working set**, not an unbounded climb. **My +488.7 MB is warm-up fill.** Corrected in `#632` and `state.md`, crediting your watch. **What survives:** at both OOMs anon was **1,390-1,637 MB** with `inactive_file` 14-229 MB, far above your plateau — so something exceeds the working set sometimes, and THAT excursion is the defect, not a steady climb. **Caveat both ways:** you read `container_memory_unreclaimable_mb`, I read `memory_anon_mb` — related, not identical; **a same-instant read of both is owed.**
  **Still good and independent of that:** at `WEB_CONCURRENCY=1` with the profile on, `/api/ops/artifacts/stream` (41 solo requests) and `/api/ops/artifacts/export` (28) retained **0.000 MB each**. The 60-70 MB shard endpoints are exonerated by measurement.
  **On your `book_quotes/<date>.state.json` finding:** my game-market curve reads those shards but its window is 2026-08-22..08-31, which is **single-writer** (every game row `source: null`; `venue_direct` begins 2026-09-01 16:11Z), so it is unaffected. Anyone extending it past 08-31 now needs your merge as well as the overlap check.
- Goal: `#624` step 6 asked for a week-long re-measure. It cannot be run, for
  TWO reasons, and this lane establishes both with evidence and makes the
  eventual run one command: (1) exchange prop capture exists on ONE date;
  (2) the daily `book_quotes` shard LOSES ROWS to a whole-file publish race.

- Hypothesis: two services each keep their OWN local copy of
  `mlb_source/tracking/book_quotes/<date>.jsonl`, append only their own rows to
  it (`open("a")`), then `publish_hot_artifact` pushes the WHOLE FILE to web --
  a whole-file REPLACE, not a merge. So web holds whichever service published
  last, and the other writer's rows vanish.
- Falsification test: if it were a clean append target, a later refetch could
  only be a SUPERSET. Measured: refetch lost 1,318 exchange rows, gained 0,
  and the loss is a clean tail truncation (0 losses at or before the cutoff)
  while sportsbook rows gained a whole new hour. CONFIRMED.
- Verification: measurement script refuses to emit a number for a date whose
  two feeds do not overlap in time, naming the defect instead of reporting a
  confident ROI off a clobbered file; multi-date support so 2026-09-08 is one
  command.
- Blocked by: none (the CAPTURE FIX is a separate production change and is NOT
- STATUS: the MEASUREMENT side is done and landed. `feed_overlap()` + a 65%
  floor refuses a clobbered date instead of scoring it, and it refuses
  2026-09-01 itself (46.1% matchable) -- the date the published +2.65% came
  from. `--allow-clobbered` reproduces it exactly. `--since/--until` pools
  dates so the 2026-09-08 run is one command. 36 tests pass.
- OWED, and BLOCKED: the `#630` item + the `#624` step 6 caveat correction in
  docs/ai_context/todo.md. That file is claimed by OPEN lane
  `game-market-entry-roi-curve` (session local_e384c18a). Not edited across
  the lane; message sent offering either to apply the text on release or to
  hand it over. Text is ready.
- **`todo.md` IS NOW RELEASED, and YOUR FILES WERE EDITED by lane
  `game-market-entry-roi-curve` (session 02ec72a5) `[user decision 2026-09-01:
  "apply those edits directly"]`.** Not a claim jump — an explicit user
  override of the cross-lane rule, logged here because that is what the
  protocol asks. **Landed on `origin/main`.** Your `#630` item is still OWED
  and still yours.
  **Why:** I re-ran YOUR script, unmodified, on the healed 2026-09-01 shard at
  the user's request. `e78aee52` is live on web, **your own guard now passes
  the date at 100.0% matchable** (was 46.1%), and every published figure moved.
  Leaving your docstring, `#624` step 6, the `#627` index row and your tests
  carrying +2.65% would have left four copies of a number the tool no longer
  produces.
  **The new reading:** gate book **n=1,235** (was 653), gain **+0.824pp** (was
  +0.949), per-side 4.05 → **3.23pp**, hold **6.5%**, **ROI +2.43%** (was
  +2.65%), shortfall **0.57** points (was 0.35). All props: n **3,774**, gross
  **70.1% / +1.709pp**, fee-aware **52.2% / +0.985pp**. **Your "the gross
  win-rate is a FEE ILLUSION" point gets STRONGER** — fee-aware 52.2% now sits
  almost exactly on the game-market 52.5% you compared it to.
  **The direction is the finding: repairing a file that had LOST rows made the
  exchange look WORSE.** Measured, not inferred — split the healed gate book at
  your clobbered copy's last sportsbook quote (20:18:49Z) and rows at or before
  it take the exchange **64.5%** of the time for **+1.021pp**, while the rows
  the repair restored take it **40.2%** for **+0.737pp**. The truncation had
  preserved exactly the window where the exchange looks best, so **the clobber
  was biased in your favour** and the +2.65% was flattered by it.
  **Your DECISION stands: step 6 NOT MET on both conditions.** Method,
  thresholds and your corrections history are untouched; only the figures
  moved. Your tests were repointed because two of them pinned +2.65% BY NAME
  while passing — a green test holding a superseded number. 76 tests pass.
  **Also: this lane block is NOT on `origin/main`** — it lives only in this
  shared tree's uncommitted copy, so nobody reading the landed ledger can see
  your lane at all. Worth landing.
- NOT IN THIS LANE: the capture fix itself. Three costed options in the
  message + commit; merge-on-receive is the one to price first. Also owed --
  a scope sweep of HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS for other files with two writers.

- **LANDED to `origin/main` by lane `game-market-entry-roi-curve` (session 02ec72a5) `[user decision 2026-09-01: "land their lane block too"]`.** This block existed ONLY in the shared primary tree's uncommitted copy, so no one reading the landed ledger could see this lane — its OPEN status, its file claims, or its findings. **Extracted and reapplied onto current `origin/main`, NOT committed from the shared tree's copy of `lanes.md`**, which is many commits behind and carries other sessions' uncommitted blocks; committing that file would have reverted what landed since and swept in work that was not mine to move. Body verbatim apart from the header parenthetical, which said "todo.md entry OWED, blocked" and would have handed the next session a blocker that no longer exists.



### maxmun-pregame-read — CLOSED 2026-09-02 — opened 2026-09-02 — session ae526656-29ed-4bb4-bee5-e3c9e4e0a583 (scheduled task `todo-628-maxmun-pregame-read`) — **GOAL MET, PASS.** `token: 'maxmun'` on a `POLYMARKET_UNMATCHED` sample for `'player': 'Max Muncy (2002)'`, refresh-worker `ad1de331`, `2026-09-02T13:46:18.027633152Z`, against a served board row for that name in `game.state = "pregame"`. The strip is EFFECTIVE in production, not merely present — `#628`'s pending read is discharged (`51f16af6`), measurement in `deploys.md` 2026-09-02 13:46:18Z (`9960572e`). `prop_same_name_collision_at_venue` = 0 on a demonstrably live instrument. No deploy: read-only.
- Goal: discharge `todo #628`'s PENDING PRODUCTION READ — one production log line
  showing a board name carrying a parenthetical disambiguator deriving its plain
  3+3 token (`maxmun`-style, never `max200`-style), taken on a PREGAME board.
- Files: .syndicate/deploys.md, .syndicate/lanes.md
- Note: the todo item's own file is deliberately NOT claimed here. The `#628`
  paragraph edit is already LANDED as `51f16af6` via the worktree flow, and
  `book-quotes-publish-clobber`'s own heading records that it RELEASED that file
  on 2026-09-01. Claiming it would manufacture a contest over a file this lane
  no longer writes.
- Hypothesis: `38dd9f41`'s parenthetical/pure-digit strip in
  `_player_name_words` is live and effective in production, not merely present.
- Falsification test: a `POLYMARKET_UNMATCHED` sample naming a disambiguated
  board player whose `token` is digit-bearing (`max200`-class) FALSIFIES it.
- Verification: the log line quoted verbatim in `.syndicate/deploys.md`, with
  the deployed refresh-worker SHA named and the token derived by executing THAT
  SHA's own tree.
- Blocked by: none

### soccer-players-csv-allowlist — CLOSED 2026-09-02 — opened 2026-09-02 — session 92987093-6cef-495b-a82b-4bb376dc45dc — **GOAL MET, VERIFIED ON BYTES.** web `2114d5c6` live; `?pattern=soccer_source/*/players/players_*.csv` returns **15 files / 879,401 bytes**, matching the local tree file for file. The reading it gates RUNS: pre-divisor **0.925** (n=9,731) → post **0.631** (n=4,546), ratio **0.682** vs **1/1.393 = 0.718** predicted — a second confirmation of the divisor sharing no denominator with the archive check that closed `#612`. **The lane-inherited `1.19 → 0.85` target is NOT reproducible by this construction (it reads the pre-divisor window at 0.925) and must not be quoted again; only the before/after on ONE instrument is valid.** Claim on web released. Detail: `deploys.md` 2026-09-02 15:0xZ.
- Goal: `#636`. `GET /api/ops/artifacts/export?path=soccer_source/<lg>/players/players_2026.csv`
  returns the CSV body instead of 403, so the board-render form of the soccer
  shot-divisor reading can run from web. One allowlist entry; deploy web.
- Files: `syndicate/features/shared/artifact_publisher.py` (HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS
  entry + its note ONLY), `tests/test_artifact_publisher.py`.
  **CLAIM CHECKED against every OPEN lane.** `artifact_publisher.py` is recorded
  in `ncaaf-week-state` as "claimed by NOBODY and is FREE TO TAKE" after
  `football-projection-publish-allowlist` (`#618`) closed on 2026-09-01. Taken here.
- Hypothesis: the allowlist is the ONLY thing blocking the read — the file is
  already on web's disk.
- **ALREADY TESTED, BEFORE ANY EDIT (this is not an assumption).**
  `soccer_source/epl/api/schedule/schedule_2026.json` is the exact analog —
  season-suffixed, git-tracked, same tree, already allowlisted — and returns
  **200, count=1, 113,410 bytes**. The target returns **403 "path is not an
  allowed hot artifact"**, which is the allowlist branch, NOT `count=0`. So web
  has the tree and the guard is the block.
- Falsification test: after deploy the path returns `count=0` instead of a body.
  That would mean the file is NOT on web's disk and an allowlist entry was the
  wrong fix — the exact shape of the 2026-08-27 FORBIDDEN rule (allowlisting a
  KEYVALUE-backed path and calling it readable turns a 403 into an empty result).
  Which is why the verification below reads BYTES, never a status code.
- Verification: (1) deployed SHA carries the pattern; (2) `?path=` returns a body
  with a `shots_per90` column; (3) the reading `#636` exists for actually RUNS —
  implied Poisson mean over that player's own season shots_per90 — and its value
  is reported. A 200 with no parse is not a pass.
- Blocked by: none.

## 2026-08-17 - THE LEDGER IS A RECORD, NOT EVIDENCE (the inverse of the same day's other lesson)

I relayed *"two uncommitted soccer fixes at risk of being lost"* to the
coordinator as an action item. **It came from a lane entry, not from a
measurement.** `git status` was empty and fix #1 was already on main.

**This is the exact inverse of the three errors recorded above it today.** There
I called healthy things BROKEN from a null lookup. Here I called a committed
thing AT RISK from a written claim I never checked. **Same root cause: treating
a statement as a reading.**

`.syndicate/**` records what was true WHEN WRITTEN. This lane was last touched
two days before I quoted it. **Before acting on or forwarding a ledger claim
about the state of the working tree - uncommitted work, missing files, a broken
service - re-measure it.** The cost here was small (a wrong action item, since
retracted). The cost of the reverse - deleting or "rescuing" files on a stale
claim - would not have been.

#### LANE RELEASE — session `bd97b64e` / `7c041356`, 2026-08-18 ~01:4xZ. **ALL HOLDS RELEASED. No file in this repo is claimed by this session any more.**

Released, with status:
- **`wnba-fixture-identity` — CLOSED.** Identity module + 40 tests shipped and on
  `main`. `game_cards` coverage fix proven on the real artifact (1 row → 3).
- **`wnba-phase2-migration` — CLOSED, code shipped, NOT ENABLED.** Autorun
  (`e65a5531`) + tests (`c7494c6c`). Its env keys are live on live-odds-worker
  and **inert until the code deploys**; it then goes hot on the FIRST tick,
  because the flag is already on and `last_epoch=0`.
- **`modelled-fair-edge` — CLOSED.** `edge_vs_modelled_fair_pct` shipped; 228 of
  258 both-terms MLB rows priced on the real payload. **NOT deployed.**
- **`soccer-projection-collapse` — CLOSED, root cause fixed, NOT deployed.**
  `#379`'s widening was inert; its only caller never passed `window_dates`.
- **`wnba-live-tier` — HOLD RELEASED.** I edited exactly ONE file under it,
  `board_enrichment.py`, one call site, on explicit user instruction ("no one has
  it"). **Everything else in that lane is untouched and its other claims stand.**
- **`export-force-refresh-escape` — CLOSED EARLIER BY OVERRIDE** (unattended
  holder, user-authorized). **Its effect measurement is still OWED and was NOT
  discharged by that close.**

**Session markers `.current-lane.7c041356-…` and `.current-lane.bd97b64e-…`
DELETED.** The other markers in that directory belong to other sessions —
including the coordinator's `9ed7fd89` — and were **not touched**.

**WHAT THE NEXT SESSION SHOULD NOT REDO:** everything above is on `main` with
tests. The remaining work is DEPLOY-GATED, not code-gated. Two requests sit with
the coordinator: **Phase 2 WNBA** and the **soccer projection window** (largest
measured effect, and it unblocks ~1,131 of the 1,416 rows the `book_margin_model`
decision was about).
