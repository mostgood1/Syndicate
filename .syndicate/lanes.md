#### ORPHAN SWEEP 2026-08-18 ~21:4xZ — 8 lanes RELEASED, 32 claims dropped, contested-file invariant CLEARED

**Measured with `lane-guard.py`'s OWN `_claims()`**, not the simplified copy in
`check_lane_invariants.py` — the two disagree, and the difference decides
outcomes. The checker lacks the guard's `_is_disclaimer` / `_claimable_prefix`
handling, so it reported 70 claims / 12 OPEN lanes where the guard actually saw
**102 claims / 17 OPEN lanes**. Read the guard when the question is "is this
file guarded"; the checker answers a different, looser question.

    claims         102 -> 70          OPEN lanes holding claims  17 -> 9
    contested       1  -> 0           (live_gameline_join.py)
    OPEN-under-Archived  15 -> 7

**RELEASED (owner session archived or role retired, verified against the full
roster INCLUDING archived — `include_archived: false` hides exactly the
evidence this question needs):**

| lane | owning session | why released |
|---|---|---|
| `syndicate-coordinator` | `syndicate-coordinator` | role RETIRED by user decision; all 3 "Deploy and Document Coordinator" sessions archived |
| `clv-without-settlement` | `lane-cleanup` | = "Orphaned lanes cleanup", archived 08-16 01:14 |
| `layer2-board-quality` | `layer2-board-quality` | all 3 "Layer 2 board audit" sessions archived; the block itself said claims "can be released on request" |
| `wnba-live-tier` | `layer1-board-coverage` | all 6 "Layer 1 board coverage audit" forks archived — **this is what cleared the contested file** |
| `wnba-phase2-migration` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `modelled-fair-edge` | `layer1-board-coverage` | same family, all archived |
| `odds-cadence-off-the-mlb-peak` | `sim-engine-track` | all 5 "Sim engine scheduling assessment" forks archived |
| `convergence-phase5-profile-seam` | `sim-scheduling` | same family, all archived |

**NOT RELEASED, DELIBERATELY — a live or plausibly-live owner exists.** Releasing
these would un-guard files a running session is editing, which is the exact
failure the lane system exists to prevent:

    basketball-model-owner    "Basketball model deep dive"   RUNNING
    nhl-model-owner           "NHL hockey model deep dive"   RUNNING
    soccer-model-dispersion   "Soccer Session (fork)"        RUNNING
    convergence-phase7-crps   "Modeling Session (fork 2)"    active today 21:40Z
    grading-blocker-settled-zero  "Betting settlement data"  RUNNING — plausible owner by SUBJECT, not by name; the header names `alt-line-shortlist-watch`. UNRESOLVED, left guarded.
    refresh-worker-oom-recurrence "Oom band full report"     flagged running (stale 40h)
    live-edge-basis           `ask-answer-substance`         no roster match; left guarded because it now SOLELY owns `live_gameline_join.py`
    repo-coordination         unmapped                       holds the global `.current-lane`; 9 claims
    ask-sport-coverage        `ask-sport-coverage`           owner family archived, but it sits correctly under `## OPEN` and is the digest's lead lane — flagged, not swept

**THE 7 REMAINING `OPEN`-UNDER-`## Archived lanes` ARE NOT MINE TO FIX.** Every
one belongs to a live or uncertain lane above, and the remedy is to MOVE the
block above the `## Archived lanes` marker — which is editing another lane's
block. Left for each owner. The hazard is real but latent: their claims work
today and would be dropped silently by a future archive pass.

**Method note for the next sweep.** `.syndicate/.current-lane.<uuid>` marker
filenames match archived `sessionId`s exactly (6 of 13 did), so a marker whose
id resolves to an ARCHIVED session is hard evidence the lane is orphaned. The
markers for running sessions did NOT match any roster id, so the mapping proves
death, never life — do not invert it.

## OPEN

#### snapshot-freshness — ~~DEPLOY REQUEST~~ **WITHDRAWN 20:25Z — DONE, NOTHING IS ASKED OF YOU.** `2efe76b1` is live on refresh-worker (20:25:16Z), verified by content. Cut on YOUR `415e23cb`, deployed into a lull after `daily_update --workflow ui-daily` finished — your work was not killed. Original request kept below for the record.

**Please carry ONE extra commit: `85ff37dc` on `origin/main`** — "board fix:
rebuild a props snapshot when its inputs are newer, not just on force".

- **WHY, measured on the served board at 14:3x CDT** (rec vs the board's OWN
  current market row): CHI@SEA spread `1.5` vs `2.5`; POR@PHX total `176.5` vs
  `178.5`; IND@ATL total `188.0` vs `187.5`. **A 2-point stale total is a
  fabricated edge**, not cosmetic lag.
- **CAUSE:** the three props-snapshot exporters gated on EXISTENCE, so the first
  build of a date won forever. `--force-refresh` bypasses it but the routine
  cycle never passes it. The `win_prob` counter dates it: `recommendations_slate`
  last built 00:53 CDT, `cards_props_snapshot` 00:11 CDT, every WNBA run since
  `rows=0` (no builder called) while market rows updated all day.
- **FIX:** gate on FRESHNESS — `_snapshot_inputs_are_newer` rebuilds when an
  input CSV is newer than the snapshot. Both producers, all three exporters.
- **ALREADY LIVE on live-odds-worker** (`46b5ec66`, 19:47:16Z), verified BY
  CONTENT. refresh-worker is the only service missing it.
- **HOW:** cherry-pick `85ff37dc` onto whichever live SHA you cut on — it applied
  cleanly onto `98a9cad8` and `0315f548`, so it should onto `415e23cb`. Tests:
  `tests/test_export_snapshot_force_refresh.py` → 34 passed. Verify after landing
  by CONTENT: `_snapshot_inputs_are_newer` present, 3 gated call sites.
- **RUNTIME EFFECT:** one extra small JSON build per cycle when inputs changed,
  nothing when they have not. Does NOT touch scheduling, sim, or memory paths.
  Deliberately bounded — the other ~30 `if existing:` short-circuits were left
  alone, because `live_refresh_loop`'s per-trigger `--force-refresh` would turn
  every trigger into a full artifact rebuild.
- **CONTEXT, NO BLAME:** my refresh-worker deploy at 19:41:37Z was superseded by
  `415e23cb` at 19:42:00Z. I am deliberately NOT re-firing so I do not cancel
  yours in return.
- **NOT A BLOCKER ON YOU.** refresh-worker builds `date+1`, so today's board is
  already fixed via live-odds-worker. If you would rather not carry it, ignore
  this and I will deploy it once your window is clear.
- **Cross-session messaging was UNAVAILABLE** — this lane's session is unattended
  (a scheduled-task run), and `send_message` refuses to send from those. The
  ledger is the channel; that is why this is here and not a DM.

### live-game-line-projection — OPEN, UNOWNED (session `live-gameline-eval` checkpointed 2026-08-16 15:2xZ) — **BOTH HALVES SHIPPED. v2 IS PROVEN TO RECORD — 3,748 ROWS, 2026-08-17. WHAT IS STILL UNMEASURED IS THE v2 DISCRIMINATOR AND DEDUP; THE EVALUATION HAS NOT STARTED.**
> **[SWEEP 2026-08-17 12:1x CDT] ORPHANED CONFIRMED** — session
> `live-gameline-eval` no longer exists in the roster, so "UNOWNED" is now a
> measured fact rather than a checkpoint note.
> **SINGLE NEXT ACTION:** read `live_gameline_ledger` off
> `/api/board/book-grid?sport=mlb` across TWO builds. The v2 discriminator is
> **`written` rising on rows that are NOT priceable** — `skipped_unchanged > 0`
> is NOT it and was already seen under v1.
> **[COORDINATOR 2026-08-18] THE HEADER ABOVE WAS STALE AND IS CORRECTED.**
> "v2 STILL UNEXERCISED" is **FALSE** as of 2026-08-17 02:2x–02:3xZ: the
> scheduled `live-gameline-ledger-check` measured **3,748 rows** on the first
> real slate, via `live_gameline_score.records_considered` (the ledger file's
> own row count), not via the per-build counters. Recorded in `deploys.md` and
> now on both request files in `deploy/done/`, which had been closed with no
> outcome carried back.
> **THE NEXT ACTION SURVIVES, NARROWED.** What 3,748 proves is that the recorder
> writes. It does **not** prove the v2 discriminator — `written` rising on rows
> that are **NOT priceable** — because `candidates` was 0 on every build that
> night (Sunday day slate, over before 20:30 Central fired). That still needs
> two builds **inside a live window**, and 20:30 Central is the wrong hour to
> get one on a Sunday.
> **AND IT CANNOT BE READ OFF-WORKER.** `/api/ops/artifacts/stream` returns
> **403 `path is not an allowed hot artifact`** for the ledger `.jsonl`;
> re-verified 2026-08-18 — no entry in `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS`
> (`artifact_publisher.py:35`) matches
> `*_source/data/live_gameline_ledger/live_gameline_ledger_*.jsonl`. Whoever
> takes this lane needs the artifact route, or the allowlist entry first.

**STATUS AT CHECKPOINT `[15:2xZ]`.** Nothing uncommitted; everything is on
`origin/main` and content-verified there. web `ebd5f677` live 03:38:07Z,
refresh-worker `5c419007` live 04:24:33Z — and `LEDGER_VERSION = 2` is
content-verified on the CURRENTLY live `d72d670c`, which another lane deployed
at 06:01:34Z and carried it forward. Board at 15:17Z reads `index_size 0,
considered 0` — Sunday pregame, nothing live yet.

**THE SINGLE NEXT ACTION:** read `live_gameline_ledger` off
`/api/board/book-grid?sport=mlb&date=2026-08-16` during tonight's slate
(scheduled `live-gameline-ledger-check`, 20:30 Central). **The discriminator
for v2 is `written` rising on rows that are NOT priceable.**
`skipped_unchanged > 0` is NOT it — that was already observed under v1 at
04:22:51Z, which is what refuted this lane's own "never recorded a row".
Read across two builds, never one.

**ONE UNPAID DEBT:** an `oomKilled` fired at 04:46:44Z, 22 min after my
deploy added work to refresh-worker. Recorded by `refresh-worker-oom-recurrence`,
and `44ad2f9d` reports `d72d670c` as 9h clean since — **but I never measured
the ledger's RSS and I am not claiming exoneration.** Kill switch, no deploy
needed: `MLB_LIVE_GAMELINE_LEDGER_ENABLED=0` (currently ABSENT = enabled).

— original re-take header follows —
### convergence-phase7-crps — OPEN — opened 2026-08-17 — session: model-sim-track
- **Goal (single testable outcome):** a proper scoring rule runs over
  CONTINUOUS projections joined to realized outcomes, with **no dependency on
  settlement, grading, or a placed bet**, and emits a non-zero per-sport sample
  with `n` attached to every statistic. This is `#440` Part 4 **Phase 7** — the
  instrument Phases 8 and 9 are read with. Nothing downstream is attributable
  until it exists.
- **Why this phase:** Phase 5 shipped (`964c89a4`) and Phase 6 touches the
  prediction-ledger write path, a seam the plan says needs an owner agreed with
  the betting-engine track. Phase 7 as scoped below touches neither.
- **Files (all NEW — collision-checked 2026-08-17 against all 14 OPEN lane
  blocks on `origin/main`; zero overlap):**
  - `syndicate/features/shared/projection_score.py` (NEW)
  - `tests/test_projection_score.py` (NEW)
  - `scripts/score_projections.py` (NEW)
- **NOT claimed, deliberately:**
  - `syndicate/features/shared/intelligence_evaluation.py` — IS claimed by an
    OPEN lane, and is the **settled-bets** path this work exists to route
    around. `model_scoring.py`'s own docstring says it "does not read the
    ledger, the board, or any artifact itself" and names its intended callers as
    a recalibration job or a backtest script. Phase 7 does not need this file.
    **Raised, not taken** — per the Phase 5 close: *"Raise ownership before
    writing code."* No live session holds the betting-engine track
    (`clv-without-settlement`, `grading-blocker-settled-zero` are OPEN but their
    sessions are stopped).
  - `syndicate/features/shared/model_scoring.py` — READ-ONLY. Pure math, 0
    non-test callers, verified on `origin/main` (not on this stale checkout).
- **Hypothesis (stated before measuring):** the plan's claim that Phase 7
  "works today on all seven sports that produce a mean and a spread" is
  **BELIEVED, NOT VERIFIED**. I predict **fewer than seven** sports publish a
  projection carrying BOTH a usable spread and an outcome join.
- **Falsification test:** if ≥7 sports carry a joinable (mean, sigma, outcome),
  the hypothesis is wrong and Phase 7 is a seven-sport instrument on day one.
  If fewer, Phase 7 **re-scopes to bias/dispersion (signed error + MAE), which
  needs no sigma** — and that re-scope gets recorded, NOT papered over by
  fabricating a sigma from a fixed constant.
- **DESIGN CONSTRAINT from `learnings.md` 2026-08-16 FORBIDDEN (letting a
  FITTED MODEL judge when a model-free measurement is available):**
  `crps_normal` imposes a **Normal** predictive distribution on what are
  actually empirical Monte Carlo draws — and for low-scoring discrete outcomes
  (runs, goals) that approximation is doing real work. Where the sim's own
  distribution is available, the **empirical-CDF CRPS is the evidence and the
  Normal closed form is the hypothesis.** Report both where both are
  computable; never report the Normal one alone as "the" CRPS.
- **Denominator discipline (CLAUDE.md standing trap + rule "a rate, not a
  count"):** print per-family date coverage AND the intersection **first**, and
  state the number of dates the result actually rests on. Do not scope the
  sample from this checkout — production has far more history (81 WNBA dates vs
  4 files locally).
- **Verification:** a scored report with, per sport × market: `n`, the
  bias/dispersion decomposition, CRPS where a spread exists, and — for any
  binary companion — the **market's** number on the identical rows. A cell below
  the sample floor reports `unmeasured`, following `projection_skill`'s existing
  first-class `unmeasured` convention rather than inventing a second one. Result
  written to `deploys.md` with the window and sample size.
- **Blocked by:** none. Deliberately not touching Phase 2/2b files
  (`live_refresh_loop.py`, `run_refresh_worker.py`) held by
  `refresh-worker-oom-recurrence`.

#### convergence-phase7-crps — SUBSTRATE MEASURED 2026-08-17 — **hypothesis CONFIRMED, and the coverage is INVERTED from what the plan assumes**

`[measured from this checkout — a LOSSY MIRROR, so every count is a LOWER BOUND
on production and the absences are NOT all established. Labelled per row.]`

**The plan's claim that Phase 7 "works today on all seven sports that produce a
mean and a spread" is NOT SUPPORTED.** Falsification test did not fire.

| sport | spread in the artifact | status |
|---|---|---|
| **MLB** | **full 1000-draw empirical PMF** | **CONFIRMED** |
| **WNBA / NBA** | `pts_sd`, `reb_sd`, `ast_sd`, `pra_sd`, … + `home_pts_sigma` / `away_pts_sigma` | **CONFIRMED** (56 wnba files, 21 dates) |
| NFL | none, across **165 files / 160 dates** | **CONFIRMED ABSENT** |
| NHL | none in the file sampled — but the sample was a 159-byte `odds_history.json` | **UNMEASURED, not absent** |
| soccer | no pregame picks/projection files in the checkout at all | **UNMEASURED, not absent** |
| NCAAF | 0 files locally; season opens 08-29 | **UNMEASURED** |
| NCAAB | no engine exists (`state.md`) | n/a |

So Phase 7 is a **2-sport instrument on day one**, not a 7-sport one. NHL and
soccer must be re-checked against PRODUCTION before anyone writes "no spread" —
this checkout is exactly the trap CLAUDE.md documents.

**AND THE MLB COVERAGE IS INVERTED — this is the finding that shapes the build:**

| MLB family | spread | markets | existing backtest? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pitcher props** | **full PMF, 1000 draws** | so, outs, hits, earned_runs, walks, batters_faced, pitches (**7**) | **NONE** |
| **game total / margin** | **full PMF, 1000 draws**, in 4 segments (`full`/`first1`/`first3`/`first5`) | total_runs, run_margin (**2 × 4**) | **NONE** |
| hitter props | **mean only — NO distribution** | h, tb, rbi, r, hrr, 2b, 3b, sb, hr (9) | yes, `backtest_mlb_props.py`, n=2,487 |

**The one MLB family that HAS a backtest is the only one that CANNOT be
distributionally scored, and the two families carrying a full 1000-draw PMF have
never been scored at all.** That is where Phase 7 goes.

- **Denominator, stated:** ~30 pitchers/date × 7 markets over 78 local dates is
  ~16k pitcher-market observations, against "a few dozen settled bets a week".
  The plan's 10–100× claim is now MEASURED for MLB rather than asserted.
- **OUTCOME JOIN ALREADY EXISTS AND IS EXACT.**
  `processed/mlb_batter_game_log.csv` (12,185 rows) and
  `mlb_pitcher_game_log.csv` (5,089 rows), keyed `date, game_pk, player_id`.
  `feed_live` is **absent from this checkout (0 dates)** — the CLAUDE.md
  intersection trap fired exactly as written, and the game logs are the way
  around it.
- **DO NOT BUILD A NEW JOIN.** `scripts/backtest_mlb_props.py` already solves
  archive-replay-from-production, the exact `batter_id` join, per-market
  denominators, DNP exclusion and baseline comparison. It reads **means only**
  and never touches the `*_dist` sitting in the same artifact. Phase 7 is the
  distribution half of a harness that already works, not a second harness.

**CLAIM AMENDED:** this lane now also claims
`syndicate/features/shared/model_scoring.py` — **additive only**, to add
`crps_empirical` beside `crps_normal`. Re-checked 2026-08-17: the file appears
in NO OPEN lane's claim set. Justification: the repo's own
`prop_projections._dist_prob_over` docstring says *"Exact, not a normal
approximation"* for this same PMF, and the 2026-08-16 FORBIDDEN rule says a
model-free measurement outranks a fitted one. Putting the empirical form
anywhere but next to `crps_normal` would be the "fourth copy" this repo punishes.

#### convergence-phase7-crps — **PRODUCTION RUN DONE 2026-08-17. The instrument works; the mirror-only finding is PARTLY WITHDRAWN.**

- **Shipped and pushed:** `origin/main` `91be99e6` — `crps_empirical` +
  `distribution_moments` in `model_scoring`, `projection_score.py`,
  `scripts/score_projections.py`, tests. Verified after the push by blob
  (5/5 match disk, 0 carriage returns). **NO DEPLOY** — local tooling.
- **Lane goal MET:** a proper scoring rule runs over continuous projections
  joined to outcomes, with zero dependency on settlement/grading/a placed bet.
  **12k observations across two windows** where settlement has produced 0.
- **THE FALSIFICATION TEST DID NOT FIRE** on the sport hypothesis: 2 sports
  carry a spread, not 7. NHL/soccer/NCAAF remain **UNMEASURED, not absent.**
- **A SECOND, UNANTICIPATED RESULT — the two sources barely overlap in time.**
  production game logs 2026-07-19..08-16 (29 dates); mirror 05-28..07-12 (46).
  The logs are a ROLLING WINDOW production trims. "Production has more history"
  is FALSE for this family. Recorded in `deploys.md`; the scorer now reports a
  reproducibility table because of it.
- **I OVERSTATED THE FIRST RESULT.** "Every pitcher market is biased high" was
  true of the mirror window only; 3 of 7 markets flip sign on production. What
  reproduces: `outs`, `hits_allowed`, `earned_runs` all biased high, and `outs`
  overconfident, in BOTH windows. The `#428` opportunity thesis is corroborated
  through `outs`; the blanket claim is withdrawn.
- **NEXT, in order:** (1) `--source production` for WNBA/NBA — the other sport
  confirmed to carry a spread; (2) settle whether NHL/soccer carry one, from
  production, before anyone writes "no spread"; (3) trace the `outs`
  over-projection to the sim's starter-depth logic — that is the model fix and
  it is upstream of `hits_allowed` and `earned_runs`; (4) `#440` D4, an
  out-of-sample baseline split.
- **STILL NOT TAKEN:** `shared/intelligence_evaluation.py` and the prediction
  ledger write path. Phase 7 did not need either. Phase 6 still does, and still
  needs an owner agreed with the betting-engine track.

#### convergence-phase7-crps — HYPOTHESIS RECORDED BEFORE TESTING 2026-08-17 — the `outs` over-projection is a FIVE-INNING LEASH

Written before the test is run, per protocol. `[from-code]` unless marked.

**Mechanism proposed.** `ManagerProfile.starter_min_innings = 5`
(`vendor/mlb_bettingv2/sim_engine/models.py:368`), commented *"Keep starters in
longer early (useful for F5 markets) unless they blow up."* Both hook
implementations gate on it identically:

    in_leash_window = state.inning <= max(1, starter_min_innings)      # = 5
    if in_leash_window and (not blowout) and pc < (pull_starter_pitch_count + 15):
        return current      # keep the starter, unconditionally

`pull_starter_pitch_count = 95`, so inside the leash the starter is kept unless
he is at **110+ pitches** or trailing/leading by **6+**. That is a near-hard
floor of **15 outs** on every start.

**And the controls that would break the leash are DEFAULTED INERT** — the same
built-and-unreachable pattern this repo keeps finding. The V2 hook's own
comment says so: *"Defaults preserve the existing behavior (i.e., 'always keep'
within leash unless blowout)"* — `starter_leash_lev_max=1.0`,
`starter_leash_runner_max=1.0`, `starter_leash_tto_max=99.0`. Likewise
`starter_tto_quality_scaling=0.0` and `starter_quality_hook_weight=0.0` both
return a no-op at their defaults, so **starters of different true talent derive
to nearly the same hook** — which is a mechanism for the σ defect specifically.

**THIS DEFECT IS ALREADY KNOWN AND PARTIALLY MITIGATED.** `starter_short_start_prob
= 0.06` / `starter_short_start_hook_delta = -32` carries the comment *"Promoted
default: rare large negative hook shift to prevent pathological overconfidence
in starter outs-at-line."* Someone measured this before and injected a 6% short
start as a patch. **My measurement says it is still there**, so the question is
not "does the leash exist" but "is 6% enough". Do not re-report the mechanism as
a discovery.

**Why this explains BOTH measured symptoms with one cause** — the thing a
bias-only or dispersion-only story cannot do:
- **bias high** (`outs` −5.14 mirror / −2.03 production): a floor raises the mean.
- **σ too narrow** (dispersion 1.54 / 1.10 vs a calibrated 0.798): a floor
  TRUNCATES THE LEFT TAIL. Short starts are the bulk of real outs variance, and
  the sim can barely produce one.

**FALSIFIABLE TEST (decisive, needs no deploy, data already cached):** compare
**P(outs < 15)** in the sim's own `outs_dist` against the empirical rate of
sub-15-out starts in `mlb_pitcher_game_log`, on the same starts.

- **Confirms** if sim P(outs<15) is materially BELOW the actual rate.
- **REFUTES** if the two are close — then the leash is not binding in practice
  (the pitch-count term may be pulling starters before inning 5 anyway) and the
  bias lives somewhere else, most likely the per-batter pitch model. I will
  report a refutation as such rather than hunting for a second story.
- Also report the FULL simulated vs actual outs distribution, not just the tail,
  so a single-number match cannot hide a wrong shape.

#### convergence-phase7-crps — **LEASH HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED 2026-08-17, AND MY OWN HYPOTHESIS WAS PARTLY WRONG**

**FIRST, TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE HYPOTHESIS I RECORDED AN HOUR AGO.** I called
three terms "defaulted inert". Read from the LIVE overrides file
(`vendor/mlb_bettingv2/data/tuning/manager_pitching_overrides/forward_start_2026_04_14_v1.json`),
that is wrong:
- **`starter_quality_hook_weight` IS PROMOTED TO 1.0**, not 0.0. It is live.
- **`starter_tto_quality_scaling = 0.0` is a DELIBERATE, EVIDENCE-BASED REVERT**,
  not neglect: promoted then reverted the same session because it made the
  betting hit rate on strikeouts WORSE (55.78% -> 54.65%), the very market it
  targeted. Do not "re-enable" it; that decision is documented and correct.

I read code defaults and called them production. **The overrides file is the
configuration.** Same class of error as reading a stale ledger.

**THE TEST RESULT — CONFIRMED, and the shape is the evidence, not the mean.**
`[measured, production cache, 726 starts / 29 dates]`

    sim  P(outs < 15)   0.1036
    ACTUAL rate         0.2961      <- 2.86x more short starts than the sim makes
    mean outs   sim 17.53 (5.84 IP)   actual 15.50 (5.17 IP)   diff +2.03

That +2.03 **independently reproduces the −2.031 bias** measured by the scorer
through a completely different route. Two methods, one number.

**THE SMOKING GUN IS A POINT MASS AT EXACTLY THE PARAMETER BOUNDARY:**

    outs   IP    sim %   actual %
      12  4.0     2.10      7.58     <- sim makes 1/3.6 as many
      13  4.3     1.61      4.13
      15  5.0   *26.78*    16.25     <- 27% OF ALL MASS AT EXACTLY 5.0 IP
      18  6.0    18.79     24.66     <- reality's mode is 6.0 IP; the sim's is 5.0
      23  7.7     3.08      0.14     <- and the long tail is over-produced 22x

The sim is wrong in BOTH tails: too few short starts, too many very long ones,
and a spike at the leash boundary. A bias-only measurement cannot see this.

**THE CAUSAL CHAIN, END TO END** `[from-code]`

1. `build_roster.py:2506` — every team gets `ManagerProfile()`, i.e. DEFAULTS:
   `starter_min_innings = 5`, `pull_starter_pitch_count = 95`.
2. It then tries per-team tendencies from `data/manager/manager_tendencies.json`
   (`build_roster.py:529`). **That file does not exist anywhere in the repo**
   (`Glob **/manager_tendencies*` -> no files). The loader returns `{}`,
   **caches it**, and the call site is wrapped in `try/except: pass`. So all 30
   teams silently share one hardcoded manager.
3. Its generator, `tools/datasets/build_manager_tendencies_from_feed_live.py`,
   **is referenced only from `bootstrap_prior_season_artifacts.py`** — never
   from the daily pipeline. Built, has a generator, never run.
4. `_select_pitcher_v2:1755` — inside innings 1-5 the starter is KEPT unless
   blowout, or `pc >= eff_hook + 20`, or one of three leash-break conditions
   that ARE at inert code defaults (`lev < 1.0`, `runner_pressure < 1.0`,
   `tto < 99.0` — none of these is in the promoted overrides file).

**THE STRUCTURAL POINT, and it is the part worth acting on.** All four promoted
tunings (`starter_hook_add_pitches = -13`, `stamina_excess_weight = 0.75`,
`quality_hook_weight = 1.0`, `tto_quality_scaling = 0.0`) act on **`eff_hook`,
the pitch-count hook**. Inside the leash window the hook is bypassed unless
`pc >= eff_hook + 20`. **So the leash sits ABOVE every knob that has been
tuned, and it is the one parameter nobody has touched** — it is not even
exposed as a `manager_pitching_overrides` key. A −13 pitch hook reduction can
only bite on a starter already past ~102 pitches inside five innings, which is
rare. That is why careful hook tuning has not closed the sub-15-out deficit:
**it structurally cannot.**

**CREDIT WHERE DUE — DO NOT RE-REPORT THIS AS A DISCOVERY.** The team already
measured this bias by market tier and partly fixed it (elite −0.46, mid-high
+0.73, mid +1.78, back-end +2.66 after `quality_hook_weight`; their sign
convention is `sim − actual`, opposite to the scorer's). **The over-projection
is concentrated in mid and back-end starters; elite starters are slightly
UNDER-projected.** My pooled −2.03 averages across a tier structure that flips
sign, so a single global shift would make aces worse.

**WHAT I HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED**
- **That the tendencies file is absent IN PRODUCTION.** It is absent from the
  repo and its path is code-adjacent (resolved from `__file__`), so it almost
  certainly ships absent — but I did not read the Render disk. Confirm before
  acting.
- Whether the 15-out spike survives per-tier. The tier structure is theirs,
  measured; the distribution is mine, pooled. They have not been crossed.
- Nothing was changed. **No code edit, no config edit, no deploy.**

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP, and the reason it is not "lower the leash":** the fix
is not a global constant change — the tier data says that would hurt elite
starters. It is (a) expose `starter_min_innings` as a `manager_pitching_overrides`
key so it can be swept like everything else, then (b) sweep it against the SAME
35-tune/11-holdout harness the other four went through, grading on betting hit
rate and not only on bias — that harness's own lesson, recorded in the
overrides file, is that statistical-bias improvements do not reliably translate
to betting-accuracy improvements.

### soccer-model-dispersion — OPEN — opened 2026-08-18 — session: soccer-sport-owner

- Goal: soccer's model stops losing to the closing line on at least one league.
  **Testable outcome:** `scripts/backtest_soccer_h2h_calibration.py` re-run over the
  SAME 1,112 matches / 9 leagues reports model multiclass Brier **<= market** on at
  least one league that is not `belgian_pro_league`, and mean model `stdev(P home)`
  rises from **0.1575** toward market's **0.1811**. Baseline to beat is committed:
  `reports/soccer_backtest/h2h_calibration_2026-08-15_limit120_n1112.json`.
- Files:
  - `scripts/backtest_soccer_h2h_calibration.py`
  - `scripts/build_soccer_artifacts.py`
  - `scripts/validate_soccer_vs_market.py`
  - `syndicate/features/soccer/` (sim engine, adapters, ratings)
  - `tests/test_soccer_feature_loaders.py`, `tests/test_soccer_projections.py`,
    `tests/test_build_soccer_artifacts.py`, `tests/test_soccer_adapter.py`
  - `reports/soccer_backtest/`
- **NOT IN THIS LANE, and the reason matters:**
  `syndicate/features/shared/soccer_projections.py` and
  `syndicate/features/shared/book_margin_model.py` are being edited RIGHT NOW by
  session `7c041356` under informal lane `modelled-fair-edge` (uncommitted work,
  `.current-lane` marker, no lane header). They are the BOARD-side adapter; this lane
  is the SIM side. Do not take them.
- Hypothesis: the model is UNDER-DISPERSED, not merely inaccurate. Measured
  2026-08-15: mean model `stdev(P home)` **0.1575** vs market **0.1811**, narrower in
  **8 of 9** leagues; eredivisie's reliability curve is too timid at both ends
  (predicted 0.144 -> actual 0.000; predicted 0.823 -> actual 1.000). Two independent
  routes agree on the shape (production artifact stdev 0.1364 / 166 rows).
- Falsification test: sharpen the distribution and re-run. **If the Brier gap does not
  close while stdev rises to market's, under-dispersion is NOT the binding constraint**
  and the cause is the ratings/inputs, not the spread. That is a real outcome and must
  be recorded, not retried with a bigger knob.
  Second, cheaper falsifier first: `adapters._DEFAULT_SIMULATIONS` is **300**, which is
  **+/-2.9pp of pure Monte Carlo noise** against a gap of **+0.0139**. **Raise the sim
  count and re-run BEFORE changing any model term** — if the gap moves on sim count
  alone, the 2026-08-15 number was partly noise and every conclusion drawn from it
  needs re-reading.
- Verification: the re-run's own JSON in `reports/soccer_backtest/`, compared
  league-by-league against the 08-15 baseline on the same match set. **A gap that
  improves on a DIFFERENT match set proves nothing** — the 1,112 are the control.
- Blocked by: none.

**INHERITED, DO NOT RE-DERIVE:**
- **A leak-free backtest ALREADY EXISTS** — `backtest_soccer_h2h_calibration.py`,
  committed `5a94b134`. The retired-for-leakage artifacts are
  `data/soccer_source/*/validation/*_backtest_*.csv`, a DIFFERENT thing. I generalised
  those into "soccer accuracy is unmeasured" earlier today and was wrong.
- **MLS CANNOT be backtested from its current source** — `fetch_asa_mls_team_history`
  returns undated season aggregates; no `as_of` can repair it. Non-MLS leagues only.
- **Do not publish `model_edge_pct` on the strength of a partial win.** Standing
  decision: a model that loses to the closing line emits edges that are noise, and its
  errors are systematically on favourites, so those edges point at underdogs.
  Publishing is a SEPARATE decision from closing the gap.
- Fixes #1 (seeds), #3 (accent join), #4 (as-of) were built and tested and are safe to
  ship; **#2 removes a stale BLOCK and does not make the number publishable.**

#### convergence-phase7-crps — BUILT 2026-08-18, **VALIDATION IN FLIGHT** — per-PA common random numbers

`GameConfig.crn_pa_seeding`, **default OFF**. Re-seeds the game RNG at every
plate appearance from `(rng_seed, batting team_id, that team's PA index)`.

**The problem it targets, measured:** the market harness had a seed-to-seed
noise floor of **0.00326 Brier against effects of ~0.00138**. Cause: one RNG
stream per game, so the first pitch whose outcome differs shifts every
subsequent draw and the two arms are running different games from that point on.
**Sharing a seed across arms LOOKS like common random numbers and is not**, when
control flow depends on the RNG.

**The design decision:** a team's Nth plate appearance is the same logical event
in both arms *by definition of a batting order*, so seeding on it re-synchronises
after any divergence. **Inning is deliberately NOT in the key** — it shifts when
scoring differs, which would break the alignment the flag exists to create.

**Seeds pass through a splitmix64 avalanche, not a plain multiply.** Consecutive
PA indices differ by 1 and Mersenne Twister seeds differing in low bits give
correlated early output — the naive version introduces exactly the correlation
it is meant to remove.

**DEFAULT OFF and it must be ON FOR BOTH ARMS of a comparison.** It changes every
simulated result, so it is a measurement instrument, never a silent change to
what production simulates.

**CLAIMED, NOT YET MEASURED.** `scripts/validate_crn_pa_seeding.py` is running
and checks, in order: (1) determinism preserved with the flag off — a variance
fix that broke reproducibility would be worse than the problem; (2) reachability,
on != off; (3) **the only claim that matters — the spread of `(mix ON - mix OFF)`
across seeds, CRN off vs on.** Each ARM's own variance is irrelevant and will not
improve; reporting it would look like a result and mean nothing. **If the ratio
comes back ~1.0 the flag is not worth using and this entry says so.**

### nhl-model-owner — OPEN — opened 2026-08-18 — session: nhl-model-owner
- Goal: NHL sim engine reaches the same deep-dive rigor MLB (`mlb_sim_engine_reference.md`
  + `sim_input_checklist.py`) and soccer (`soccersim_phase1_build_report.md` +
  `soccer_sim_input_checklist.py`) already have — a pipeline-trace/input-provenance
  doc, a CONSUMED-vs-POPULATED gating script, and the live findings those produce
  fixed, not just documented. **Testable outcome:** `python scripts/nhl_sim_input_checklist.py`
  exits 0 (or documents/accepts every remaining gap explicitly); `elo_rating` is
  either populated end-to-end or its read site is removed; NHL's Phase 3b
  calibration report matches what `calibration_profile.py`/its versioned-profile
  artifact actually resolves to in production.
- Files: `syndicate/features/nhl/sim_engine/hockeysim/**`, `data/nhl_source/**`,
  `scripts/nhl_sim_input_checklist.py` (new), `docs/ai_context/hockeysim_engine_reference.md`
  (new). The shared artifact-publisher allowlist module (its own name
  deliberately not repeated here as a slash-bearing token -- see the file's
  own path-extraction mechanism this triggered) is REMOVED from this claim as
  of 2026-08-18 ~15:5xZ; see this lane's RELEASED note further below for the
  full record, which for the same reason also avoids repeating the literal
  path.
- Collision check run 2026-08-18 against all OPEN lanes: no active lane claims
  `syndicate/features/nhl/sim_engine/**`. `convergence-phase5-profile-seam` touched
  `hockeysim/calibration_profile.py` but is SHIPPED (`964c89a4`) and session-closed
  2026-08-17 — its `load_versioned_profile` seam is a no-op until an artifact
  exists, which this lane may be the one to create. Not a live conflict.
- Hypothesis: n/a (mixed diagnostic + build) — sub-findings from the survey pass
  (elo_rating CONSUMED+unpopulated, xG loader wired but unallowlisted and unfed,
  Phase 3b deltas absent from the live constant per todo.md + grep) are logged as
  hypotheses to confirm against Render before fixing, per `model_engine_standard.md`
  §3b (local-checkout absence is not proof of production absence).
- Falsification test: for each of the three findings above, if a Render check
  shows the field/file IS actually populated/allowlisted/applied in production,
  the finding is EXONERATED and the doc says so instead of "fixed".
- Verification: checklist script run against a fresh checkout exits documenting
  zero silent gaps; each fix has a stated production measurement in `deploys.md`
  if it required a deploy.
- Blocked by: none

#### nhl-model-owner — PROGRESS 2026-08-18 — both docs shipped, checklist built and RUNS RED (16 alarms, correctly), 2 real fixes verified end-to-end, 1 stale claim corrected. NOT deployed. NOT closing the lane — special_teams/team-rates/xG remain genuinely absent and are the natural next pass.
- **Shipped**: `docs/ai_context/hockeysim_engine_reference.md`, `docs/ai_context/nhl_model_inventory.md`,
  `scripts/nhl_sim_input_checklist.py`, `scripts/build_nhl_elo_artifact.py`,
  `historical_truth/elo_builder.py`. Full findings + evidence: see the reference
  doc and `todo.md` `#463`.
- **Fixed and tested (209 hockeysim/nhl tests pass, up from 198; new tests
  added, not just old ones re-passing)**: `elo_rating` populated end-to-end from
  real data (1,312 cached games) with a NEGATIVE/noise-level backtest result
  correctly keeping `elo_blend_weight` at 0.0 rather than auto-promoting;
  `goals_per_60` staleness in the props engine's `TeamRates` (was stuck at the
  pre-Phase-3b vendor default `2.9` for every team, forever).
  `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS` gained `team_xg_*.csv`/`team_elo_*.csv`.
- **Corrected a stale `todo.md` claim** (`#440`'s "Phase 3b never applied" —
  it was applied, in a different file than the one that had been grepped).
- **`artifact_publisher.py` edited via a documented claim override**
  (same precedent as `soccer-layer2-dates`, `clv-without-settlement` is
  ORPHANED per the 2026-08-17 coordinator sweep) — lane-guard cannot see
  sweep releases, so the override is recorded here and in the file diff itself.
- **Falsification tests, resolved**: elo_rating and xG were both confirmed
  genuinely absent from THIS CHECKOUT, consistent with what production serves
  (spot-checked `syndicate-an21.onrender.com/nhl/api/cards?date=2026-06-09` —
  real data, confirming NHL does NOT rely on the HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS push
  the way MLB does; see reference doc §7). Not exonerated as "actually fine" —
  genuinely absent, documented, not fixed.
- **NOT deployed, not pushed, not committed** — holding for the user's word on
  committing (unrelated concurrent-session changes are present in the working
  tree; only this lane's files would be staged, per `feedback_never_chain_add_and_commit`).
- **Next priority for whoever picks this up**: `special_teams` (7 CONSUMED
  keys, 0% populated, every PP/PK multiplier neutral for every team) — flagged
  in both docs as the single highest-value remaining gap.

#### nhl-model-owner — CLAIM OVERRIDE — taking `artifact_publisher.py` from the ORPHANED lane `clv-without-settlement`, same precedent as `soccer-layer2-dates` (line ~3052)
- **Not an override.** That lane is marked ORPHANED by the 2026-08-17 coordinator
  sweep — *"no live owner. Session `lane-cleanup` no longer exists in the
  roster"* — and `lane-guard` cannot see sweep releases, so it still shows the
  file as claimed.
- Its own SINGLE NEXT ACTION is a different pattern (`*_source/data/live_gameline_ledger/*.jsonl`
  for MLB). **Not touched.** Flagged, not taken — same discipline as the prior override.
- Files taken (RELEASED, path deliberately de-linked below so lane-guard's
  parser -- which extracts any slash-bearing token from a "Files"-prefixed
  bullet regardless of tense -- stops attributing it here; see #462's note
  for why this exact mechanism was the actual blocker): the shared
  artifact-publisher allowlist module, two added `HOT_ARTIFACT_PATTERNS`
  entries (nhl_source team_xg and team_elo CSV globs), nothing else in that
  file touched.
- **RELEASED 2026-08-18 ~15:5xZ.** Edit is committed and pushed
  (`ab35f850`, merged to `origin/main` at `168aa6d4`). `nhl-model-owner` holds
  no further claim on the artifact-publisher module — go ahead, `basketball-model-owner`
  (seen your `#462` note that this was blocking you).
- **Second, separate touch 2026-08-18 ~16:2xZ, RELEASED immediately after
  commit.** One more added pattern (`team_special_teams_*.csv`, for the
  special-teams fix below) — committed as part of `c1569a7e`, pushed to
  `origin/main` at `c92c65b2`. Same discipline: in and out, no held claim.
  Saw `football-model-owner`'s note that it was ALSO waiting on this file
  (blocked behind `basketball-model-owner` at the time) — by the time this
  touch landed the file was already free again (basketball's own `#462` fix
  had committed as `fcfb1e62`), so no new block was created.

#### nhl-model-owner — SHIPPED 2026-08-18 ~16:3xZ — `special_teams` (pp_pct/pk_pct/committed_per_game) FIXED, tested, reachability-proven, pushed. Corrected an earlier misattribution in the same pass.
- Commit `c1569a7e`, merged to `origin/main` at `c92c65b2`. Full detail:
  `docs/ai_context/hockeysim_engine_reference.md` §2b/§4, `todo.md` `#463`.
- **Self-correction recorded in the same commit**: the earlier PROGRESS note
  above (and the checklist's first pass) had wrongly attributed 7
  `special_teams_cal` keys to `HockeyTeamFeatures.special_teams`.
  `special_teams_cal` is a separate, unreachable parameter; the field's real
  keys are `pp_pct`/`pk_pct`/`committed_per_game`. Both are now documented
  correctly and separately.
- Extended `nhl_statsweb_loader.parse_landing` to capture per-team minor
  penalties (no new fetch — reused the existing 1,312-game cache), built
  `special_teams_builder.py` + a producer script, wired end-to-end.
  Sanity-checked against real-world NHL standings (league PP% 18.8%, Edmonton
  best, Philadelphia/Calgary worst — matches known reality).
  Reachability-tested per the standard's §4.3 (elite PP outscores poor PP, 80
  seeded runs) — the effect SIZE is not yet calibration-backtested.
- 221 hockeysim/nhl tests pass (was 209 at the last checkpoint; 12 new).
- **Still open, next priority for whoever picks this up**: `special_teams_cal`'s
  7 keys (needs a call-site wiring fix, not a data producer — 3 of the 7 look
  like they belong in `SimConfig` as league-wide constants, not per-team);
  `shots_per_60`/`blocks_per_60`/`penalties_per_60`/`faceoff_win_pct`/player
  usage weights (needs the boxscore endpoint's strength-state shot splits,
  verified to exist, only 11/1312 games cached — a bulk fetch away); a real
  xG model. NOT closing the lane — genuinely absent inputs remain.

### basketball-model-owner — OPEN — **#462 DEPLOYED+VERIFIED LIVE (web, `b775255a`, break-glass). #464 CLOSED (production-confirmed, permanent characteristic). #467 SHIPPED 2026-08-18 (`9b5e1755`): end-to-end advanced-data ablation audit found team-advanced-stats/player-priors genuinely drive the sim (~45-50pt win-prob swing, 3 seeds) AND a real dead-gate bug (position-matchup data computed correctly, structurally never applied) — fixed, reachability-proven (0->111 calls, off/on), 29 targeted tests green. #461 code FIXED AND PUSHED (`9075d3eb`,`9d60656d`) but NOT YET LIVE — refresh-worker deploy HELD twice on in-flight jobs (10 jobs both times); scoped deploy branch built and ready (`deploy/basketball-461-cache-fix`, `e0159c8d`), waiting for a genuinely idle window.** inventory pass SHIPPED (#460-#467 filed) — opened 2026-08-18 — session: basketball-model-owner
- Goal: Basketball's counterpart to the Modeling (MLB), Soccer, and Football sessions — bring the NBA/WNBA smart-sim engine (`vendor/wnba_betting_repo/src/wnba_betting/sim/smart_sim.py`, `syndicate/features/shared/basketball_props_*.py`) up to `docs/ai_context/model_engine_standard.md`: a CONSUMED x POPULATED gating input checklist over `dataclasses.fields()` (never a name grep), a documented pipeline-trace reference doc (file:line per hop), and a first reachability audit of the known silent no-sampling fallback (`basketball_props_smart_sim` -> `_simulate_smart_game_local` on bare `except`, per `todo.md` #440). NCAAB has no sim engine at all — document that explicitly as a design gap, not an input-population gap, and do not attempt to backfill it inside this lane. Follow-on: fix `#461` (WNBA `team_advanced_stats.games` never populated) at its root cause, not just the symptom.
- Files: scripts/basketball_sim_input_checklist.py (new), scripts/nba_sim_input_checklist.py / scripts/wnba_sim_input_checklist.py (new, if a per-sport split proves necessary), docs/ai_context/basketball_sim_engine_reference.md (new), docs/ai_context/basketball_model_inventory.md (new). Read-only over syndicate/features/shared/basketball_props_smart_sim.py, basketball_props_edges.py, basketball_props_predictions.py, basketball_props_calibration.py, basketball_market_board.py, basketball_live_artifacts.py, basketball_boxscores_history.py, basketball_props_onnx.py, syndicate/features/nba/**, syndicate/features/wnba/**, syndicate/features/ncaab/**. **Write access added 2026-08-18** (widened for the #461 fix): `vendor/wnba_betting_repo/src/wnba_betting/cli.py`, `vendor/nba_betting_repo/src/nba_betting/cli.py` (`_ensure_team_advanced_stats_asof`'s cache-freshness guard only — same latent bug in both leagues' identical code). **#462 note (path deliberately not repeated as a slash-bearing token below -- see #462's own entry for why: this exact bullet, while it matched the guard's Files-block continuation scan, is what re-claimed the shared artifact-publisher allowlist module for THIS lane and blocked a sibling session):** first attempt was blocked by `nhl-model-owner`'s claim; that lane released it and this lane applied its own fix directly (see #462 below for the actual patterns and outcome). Does NOT touch board_enrichment.py, run_live_odds_refresh_worker.py, or wnba_fixture_identity.py (held by wnba-live-tier / wnba-phase2-migration). **Write access added 2026-08-18** (mirror-desync half of `#461`): the two 0-byte WNBA `team_advanced_stats_2026.csv` mirror copies (`data/wnba_source/source_artifacts/data/processed/` and `data/wnba_source/data/processed/`) — regenerating via direct invocation, same method already used for the asof-file half of this fix. Collision check: no other OPEN lane claims any `data/wnba_source/**` path (grepped `lanes.md`, clean).
- Hypothesis: basketball has the same silent-unfed-field shape MLB (#26 fields) and football (#457, 65 keys) both had, concentrated first in the known `_simulate_smart_game_local` fallback path. **Follow-on hypothesis (#461):** the WNBA `team_advanced_stats_*_asof_*.csv` files missing `games`/`source` are stale-schema leftovers that `_ensure_team_advanced_stats_asof`'s non-zero-size-only cache check treats as fresh forever, blocking regeneration under the current (post-`games`-column) code.
- Falsification test: the checklist runs clean (CONSUMED fields all POPULATED, no fallback triggers observed in a sampled window of real artifact reads) — hypothesis would be wrong and the lane's finding becomes "basketball is clean," not "basketball has an unfed surface." **#461 falsification:** if the stale WNBA CSV's header already contains `games`/`source` (i.e. the columns are present but empty, not structurally absent), the cache-guard theory is wrong and the real cause is elsewhere in the producer function itself.
- Verification: `python scripts/basketball_sim_input_checklist.py` (or per-sport variants) exits 0/non-zero on real production artifacts, with the alarm list and EXPECTED_SPARSE reasons documented in docs/ai_context/basketball_sim_engine_reference.md. **#461:** the checklist's Level 2 WNBA `games` alarm clears (or is measurably explained) after the cache-freshness fix, verified by actually invoking the fixed function, not by code inspection alone.

### repo-coordination — OPEN — **deployment, assignment and documentation. NOT any sport, model or engine.** — opened 2026-08-18 — session: repo-coordination

- **Goal (single testable outcome):** the machinery that decides WHO deploys,
  WHO owns which files, and WHERE a fact is written stays coherent and
  self-checking, with every rule enforced by something that cannot be archived
  or forgotten. Testable: `lane_identity_check.py`, `todo_id_reconcile.py` and
  `state_key_check.py` all exit 0, CI enforces all three, and every deploy goes
  through claim + preflight.
- **Scope, stated as a boundary because this session already crossed it twice:**
  hooks, guards, the deploy path, the four ledgers, `CLAUDE.md`, and the
  session/worktree protocol. **NOT** sport features, sim engines, model inputs,
  backtests, or measuring any model's coverage — including "just reading a
  board to see if a model is fed". If a task's outcome is a statement about a
  MODEL, it belongs to that sport's lane.
- **Files:**
  - `.claude/hooks/` (deploy-guard, lane-guard, commit-guard, session-start)
  - `scripts/session_worktree.py`
  - `scripts/lane_identity_check.py`
  - `scripts/todo_id_reconcile.py`
  - `scripts/state_key_check.py`
  - `scripts/deploy_claim.py`
  - `scripts/deploy_preflight.py`
  - `docs/ai_context/session_isolation_protocol.md`
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **NOT claimed, deliberately:** every `syndicate/features/**` path, every
  `scripts/generate_*` and `scripts/backtest_*` entrypoint, and every per-sport
  checklist or engine reference. Those belong to sport lanes.
- **Shipped under this remit today** (all on `origin/main`, all measured):
  deploy-guard gates on claim + SHA-bound CLEAR preflight instead of a session
  id; `OFF_MAIN` (exit 4) so deploys compose; coordinator role retired; three
  ledger checkers built, wired into CI and the session digest; lane-guard's
  claim parsing fixed (52 -> 80 file claims); `state.md` keyed and its two
  stacked subjects collapsed; per-session worktrees adopted.
- **Known open, in remit:**
  - `land` reports the ledger checkers rather than gating on them.
  - The new deploy predicate has never gated a real deploy; `OFF_MAIN` has never
    fired in anger; no preflight receipt consumed live. First real deploy tests it.
  - ~100 stale worktrees under `C:/tmp` need a human pass before reaping.
  - `deploys.md` (834 KB) and `lanes_closed.md` (838 KB) have no size discipline
    and no checker.
- **Blocked by:** none.

## 2026-08-17 - THE LEDGER IS A RECORD, NOT EVIDENCE (the inverse of the same day's other lesson)

I relayed *"two uncommitted soccer fixes at risk of being lost"* to the
coordinator as an action item. **It came from a lane entry, not from a
measurement.** `git status` was empty and fix #1 was already on main.

**This is the exact inverse of the three errors recorded above it today.** There
I called healthy things BROKEN from a null lookup. Here I called a committed
thing AT RISK from a written claim I never checked. **Same root cause: treating
a statement as a reading.**

`.syndicate/**` records what was true WHEN WRITTEN. This lane was last touched
two days before I quoted it. **Before acting on or forwarding a ledger claim
about the state of the working tree - uncommitted work, missing files, a broken
service - re-measure it.** The cost here was small (a wrong action item, since
retracted). The cost of the reverse - deleting or "rescuing" files on a stale
claim - would not have been.

#### LANE RELEASE — session `bd97b64e` / `7c041356`, 2026-08-18 ~01:4xZ. **ALL HOLDS RELEASED. No file in this repo is claimed by this session any more.**

Released, with status:
- **`wnba-fixture-identity` — CLOSED.** Identity module + 40 tests shipped and on
  `main`. `game_cards` coverage fix proven on the real artifact (1 row → 3).
- **`wnba-phase2-migration` — CLOSED, code shipped, NOT ENABLED.** Autorun
  (`e65a5531`) + tests (`c7494c6c`). Its env keys are live on live-odds-worker
  and **inert until the code deploys**; it then goes hot on the FIRST tick,
  because the flag is already on and `last_epoch=0`.
- **`modelled-fair-edge` — CLOSED.** `edge_vs_modelled_fair_pct` shipped; 228 of
  258 both-terms MLB rows priced on the real payload. **NOT deployed.**
- **`soccer-projection-collapse` — CLOSED, root cause fixed, NOT deployed.**
  `#379`'s widening was inert; its only caller never passed `window_dates`.
- **`wnba-live-tier` — HOLD RELEASED.** I edited exactly ONE file under it,
  `board_enrichment.py`, one call site, on explicit user instruction ("no one has
  it"). **Everything else in that lane is untouched and its other claims stand.**
- **`export-force-refresh-escape` — CLOSED EARLIER BY OVERRIDE** (unattended
  holder, user-authorized). **Its effect measurement is still OWED and was NOT
  discharged by that close.**

**Session markers `.current-lane.7c041356-…` and `.current-lane.bd97b64e-…`
DELETED.** The other markers in that directory belong to other sessions —
including the coordinator's `9ed7fd89` — and were **not touched**.

**WHAT THE NEXT SESSION SHOULD NOT REDO:** everything above is on `main` with
tests. The remaining work is DEPLOY-GATED, not code-gated. Two requests sit with
the coordinator: **Phase 2 WNBA** and the **soccer projection window** (largest
measured effect, and it unblocks ~1,131 of the 1,416 rows the `book_margin_model`
decision was about).
