### 2026-08-12 — EXONERATED: the soccer window is not the egress cause
- What we believed: the change that tripled dates per sweep (5–6 → 15–18),
  shipped the same day the egress spike was noticed, caused the spike.
- What was actually true: the 14-day graph shows the same spikes since
  7/30, predating the change entirely.
- How we found out: looked at the metric *before* the change instead of
  only after it.
- The rule going forward: **before blaming a recent change for a symptom,
  pull the metric back far enough to see whether the symptom predates it.**
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

### 2026-08-12 — Do not batch changes during a diagnosis
- What we believed: shipping the guard and the rate ceiling together
  would resolve things faster.
- What was actually true: with #394 and #395 landing together, neither
  effect could be attributed cleanly. The egress drop cannot be assigned
  to the guard.
- The rule going forward: **while diagnosing, one substantive change per
  deploy, with a measurement window closed before the next one starts.**
  Enforced by `/preflight` question 1.
- Cost: a permanently ambiguous data point in `deploys.md`.

### 2026-08-12 — A rate ceiling is not a fix
- The rule going forward: **a cap makes a graph look healthy while the
  underlying waste continues.** Never close a lane on the strength of a
  metric that is being clamped. Measure the uncapped behaviour, or
  measure something the cap does not touch.

### 2026-08-12 — Parallel sessions on one problem need lane discipline
- What was actually true: a second coding session worked the same problem
  concurrently, with no shared record of hypotheses tried or ruled out.
- The rule going forward: **hypotheses go into the lane before they are
  tested, and exonerations are written down as loudly as findings.** The
  expensive failure is re-litigating a dead end three sessions later.

### 2026-08-13 — A grep excerpt is not the file
- What was actually true: a `grep` result rendered
  `open("/proc/self/status")` as `open("\proc\self\status")`. A
  permanently-inert memory guard was half written up on that basis —
  against another lane's freshly shipped work.
- The rule going forward: **read the file before filing a defect against
  a literal.** Search output is a pointer, not evidence. `sed -n` on the
  path is authoritative where a tool's excerpt is not.
- Cost: none, caught before filing. Records the near-miss because the
  next one will not announce itself.

### 2026-08-10 — a briefed premise is a hypothesis, not a starting condition
- What was believed: soccer sims were OFF by standing instruction, so the lane
  was working against a mitigated system.
- What was actually true: the autorun flag was `'true'` live, all three sim
  fixes were ancestors of the deployed commit, and a 20m13s sim was running.
  **Nothing had been mitigating it all evening.**
- The rule going forward: **verify the premise of the brief before writing code
  against it.** Checking cost one env query and one ancestry check; it changed
  the urgency of the whole lane.

### 2026-08-15 — a threshold is calibrated against a SPAN; changing what the span contains invalidates it without touching the constant
- **The rule going forward:** before deploying, ask what else READS the window
  whose contents you are changing — thresholds, guards, timeouts, caches sized
  against "a pass". Grep the span's own markers for constants that mention it. A
  threshold invalidated this way appears in NO diff, so review cannot catch it;
  only asking the question can.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-15 — EXONERATED: "eight hydrated sports at once cannot fit in 4GiB"

The `#387` handoff carried this as settled, from the 20:03:11Z kill: peak = SUM
across eight sports "is sufficient on its own to cross 4GiB", and "the floor
plays no part". Measured on the SAME evening, on the pre-cutover code:

    22:36:48 -> 22:37:43   8 sports hydrated   PEAK 804.2 MB anon  (19.6%)
    22:49:19 -> 22:49:50   8 sports hydrated   PEAK 613.1 MB anon  (15.0%)

The shape that "cannot fit" ran twice, twenty minutes apart, at a fifth of the
ceiling. **The eight-sport pass is exonerated as a sufficient cause.** The
20:03:11Z kill remains UNEXPLAINED: something made MLB cost +3.5GB in that pass
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

### 2026-08-15 — FORBIDDEN: never conclude "no OOM" from a LOG search. Kills are EVENTS, and I had this rule already
- **The rule going forward:** a negative result about process death MUST come
  from the events API. `scripts/render_logs.py` cannot answer this question and
  a 0-match result from it is not evidence. Absence of a log line is evidence
  about the EMITTER, and a killed process emits nothing.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-15 — the kill is MLB game hydration in pid 39, not the overview pass

Measured at the 00:41:16 kill, the best-instrumented one:

    00:40:14  container 3357.8MB (82.0%)   pid 39 = 1612.1MB   7 processes
    00:40:42  container 4095.8MB (100.0%)  pid 39 = 3079.6MB   10 processes
    00:40:58  anon 3941.6 -> 4047.6MB in 1.2s, game_count 15, unreclaimable 4058MB
    00:41:16  server_failed oomKilled 4Gi

**pid 39 — the main worker — grew ~1.47GB in 28 seconds** while its children
stayed small (`daily_update.py` 166.6MB, soccer odds refresh 95.5MB). The
payloads carry `game_count: 15` / `game_pk_count: 15`, i.e. the MLB game
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

## 2026-08-14 — OVERTURNED: a number that corrects a known bias is the easiest one to believe

- **Believed:** the joiner's first same-book CLV, `avg_clv_pct = -5.215` over 25 rows (beat-close 9/25), was the first honest measurement of our closing-line value. It was the number the whole lane existed to produce.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-14 — a control with no baseline is a guess wearing a control's clothes

- **2023-2025**), unrelated to the MLB window (2026-08-01..08-14), and they predate the deploy. **I had baselined the MLB props before deploying and never baselined non-mlb** — so the control's expected value was assumed, not measured.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-14 — read the system's clock, not the wall clock

- The rule going forward: **before firing a pinned deploy, re-read the service's live commit AND check for an in-flight deploy; then pin onto whatever is live at that moment, not onto what was live when the branch was built.** A pinned branch is a snapshot with an expiry date, and the expiry is the next deploy by anyone. Where two lanes are shipping the same service, stack — cherry-pick onto their commit — rather than racing from a shared base.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — RULE: WEB DOES NOT RUN `main`. Parent a deploy on the LIVE SHA.

- **The rule going forward.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — A CADENCE IS A DISTRIBUTION ACROSS REGIMES, NOT A CONSTANT

- **The belief.** "MLB quote capture runs on a metronomic ~121.6-minute beat." It sat in `state.md` with a proper measurement behind it (seven captures in 18h, read from the artifact rather than the logs — good method), it was carried into the program plan as a hard floor on the Tier 5 measurement, and it was the premise of a standing freeze on 23 movement implementations, `movement_velocity` and the steam detector.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — ANCESTRY OF `origin/main` IS NOT DEPLOYMENT; READ THE DEPLOYED TREE

- **The near-miss.** Asked whether the per-sport pregame cooldown had shipped, the first check was `git merge-base --is-ancestor ea8fad58 origin/main` → **yes**. On a repo where `autoDeploy = no`, that answer means nothing about production, and taken alone it would have reported a fix as live that is not.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — RULE: a "baseline" is a FILE you diffed, not a number you quoted

- **The rule going forward:** a shared stylesheet exists precisely so one class renders in more than one place, so **one sample per class is not a measurement of that class** — key the table by surface and report a class whose computed value differs across surfaces as CONFLATED rather than collapsing it to its first hit. `scripts/ui_layout_probe.py` now does this and the whole story is in `docs/reports/ui_audit_2026_08_14/README.md`, because the wrong number outlived the probe that produced it and got written into two plans.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## Compacted entries (rule kept here, evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)
> Compacted 2026-08-15: entries before 2026-08-15 keep their heading and their
> rule. Nothing was deleted. The full working — what we believed, how we
> found out, the cost — is in `learnings_evidence.md` under the same heading.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-12 — FORBIDDEN: never point a worker publish URL at a public hostname
- The rule going forward: **any service-to-service call inside Render must use the internal private-network hostname. Same-region private traffic is unbilled. Audit every URL env var against this rule before adding a new one.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A guard can measure a number that moves without the system moving
- The rule going forward: **when a threshold decides whether work runs, audit what moves the quantity it reads — not just the constant.** A stale constant is the easy half. A quantity that swings on kernel LRU bookkeeping makes the guard's verdict unrelated to the risk it guards. Guard on unreclaimable memory (`anon + shmem + slab_unreclaimable`), which is what an OOM kill actually responds to.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A criterion has a DIRECTION, and checking it is free
- The rule going forward: before instrumenting, ask **which way the suspected fault would push the observable.** Extends "a criterion is an instrument too": an instrument has a sign as well as a denominator.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — Confirm an instrument can emit non-zero before believing its zero
- The rule going forward: before believing a zero, produce a case that makes the same instrument read non-zero — or build the reading so it carries its own liveness proof. `snapshot_prop_keys` is populated before any filtering, so a zero beside a non-empty key list is a *measured* zero, not a blind one.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A pooled denominator can make a measurement unreadable
- The rule going forward: when a counter pools populations with different eligibility, **split it by the thing that determines eligibility** before reading it. "The mechanism failed" and "most rows were never eligible" produce the identical zero. Sibling of the wrong-denominator shape recorded the same night, arrived at from the other direction.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — `git log --format=%an` is zero evidence in this repo
- The rule going forward: **the only working discriminator is which FILES a lane has touched.** Verify a ticket number against `origin/main` immediately before pushing, not when drafting — the gap between choosing and pushing is a real race.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-10 — an instrument's blind spot will be mistaken for a finding
- The rule going forward: **ask what the instrument cannot see before trusting what it shows, and compute the base rate before believing a coincidence.** Both directions of this error were made in one evening on the same candidate.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-10 — segment on process boundaries before any neighbour-based test
- The rule going forward: **any local/neighbour test must segment on boot first.** A restart is a discontinuity, not a data point.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-10 — counts are the wrong denominator when the cost is bytes
- The rule going forward: **before quoting a rate, check the denominator actually measures the thing being paid for, and that it spans the population of interest.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — Presence is not reachability: verify the PATH, not the symbol
- **Overturned belief:** that confirming a fix is present in the deployed code means the observed behaviour goes through it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A safety gate answers ITS question, not the one you were asked
- The rule going forward: **when a human states a condition, encode THAT condition, not the nearest existing check.** A pre-built guard is evidence about its own predicate only. Before arming any watcher, write down the instruction's condition and the instrument's condition as two separate sentences; if they are not the same sentence, the instrument is not sufficient and needs the missing clause added explicitly.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — "Identical to origin" does not mean "absent from the commit"
- The rule going forward: **to claim a change is ABSENT from a deploy, compare the target against what is LIVE, not against the branch you built on.** The live commit is the only baseline the deploy actually acts on, and it moves under you while you work.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — "Who reads this env var" is a grep question; "does this service read it" is not
- The rule going forward: **reachability has three entry classes, and a trace that omits any one of them is not evidence. (1) module-level statements, including calls to functions defined elsewhere in the file; (2) the specific symbols another module imports — not the module as a whole; (3) indirect targets: thread/process `target=`, callbacks, registries, decorators.** Exclude `if __name__ == "__main__"`. A negative result from an incomplete trace is indistinguishable from a real one, so state which classes were covered whenever the conclusion is "unreachable, safe to delete."
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — FORBIDDEN: never `cat` a ledger file into hook stdout — a hook delivers the obligation, not the content
- The rule going forward: **a hook is a channel with a budget, and the only measurement that counts is what ARRIVES, not what was emitted.** Verify a hook by reading the `attachment` record in the consuming session's transcript (`stdout` length, `exitCode`, `type`), never by running the script in a terminal — a terminal has no cap, so it can only ever confirm the emitter. Keep hook stdout under **2,000 B**. A hook's job is to deliver the OBLIGATION to read the ledger plus the few facts too costly to miss; the ledger itself gets read from disk by the session. Direct sibling of `2026-08-13 — Presence is not reachability`: the content was present at the emitter and unreachable at the destination.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — EXONERATED: `shell: "bash"` in a Windows hooks block works
- Named as the likely culprit when SessionStart could not be verified ("if the ledger doesn't appear, the likely culprit is `shell: "bash"` not being honored"). Measured working: session `ac67a9f1`, Claude Code **2.1.227**, `hookName=SessionStart:startup`, `exitCode=0`, `durationMs=459`, `stderr` empty, `type=hook_success`, on a `.sh` script invoked as `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A guard that has never once PASSED is not a guard
- The rule going forward: **a guard's pass branch needs a witness too.** The ledger already says "before believing a zero, produce a case that makes the instrument read non-zero" — this is the same rule pointed at the other branch. An alarm that has never been silent is indistinguishable from an alarm wired to a constant. Check the distribution of a guard's outcomes before quoting any single one: all-fire and all-pass are both evidence of a broken predicate, not of a system state.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A discriminator that is only emitted on FAILURE cannot confirm a fix
- The rule going forward: **when choosing a signal to prove a fix ran, check which BRANCH emits it.** A signal on the failure path proves the failure path; it can never prove the success path. Before deploying, ask "if this works perfectly, what line appears?" If the answer is "none", there is no liveness proof and the deploy ships blind, however green the tests were.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A watcher's headline can contradict its own body
- The rule going forward: **the label a script prints is an assertion, and it must be entailed by the condition that triggered it.** When writing a watcher, state the exit condition in the output next to the verdict, so a reader can check the inference rather than trust the adjective. Sibling of `an instrument's SPAN is not its NAME` — same failure, moved from a timing mark to a boolean.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A guard's "is this mine" input must not default to the locked state
- The rule going forward: **when a guard reads an identity token to decide "yours vs theirs", the absent case must default to PERMISSIVE-with-a-reason, not to deny.** Absent identity is not a hostile identity, it is a missing input, and the failure surfaces as a confusing cross-lane collision message rather than as "the marker is missing". Same shape as the ledger's `unknown must not default permissive`, inverted: there the danger was a failed join relaxing a rule, here it is a failed join inventing a conflict.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A path one toolchain resolves and another cannot makes a guard pass silently
- The rule going forward: **this machine has two path universes, and a value that crosses between them fails open rather than erroring.** Bash-tool paths (`/tmp`, `/c/...`) are invisible to native Windows Python and to `python3` invoked from PowerShell; `git cat-file blob origin/main:path` is mangled by MSYS arg conversion into `origin\main;path` and returns an empty pipe, not an error. Fixtures and payloads handed to a Windows interpreter must use `C:/...`. When a check produces no output at all, verify it reached its own code before believing its verdict — extends `2026-08-13 — Confirm an instrument can emit non-zero before believing its zero`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A free-text status field cannot be a predicate; test guards against the ledger, not against synthetics
- The rule going forward: **a guard whose input humans hand-write must be tested against the actual file, not against examples written by the same person who wrote the guard.** Re-run guards over the live ledger after any parsing change, and diff the set they classify as open against the lanes physically under `## OPEN` — a mismatch is the whole test. Where a field is free text, match a word (`\bOPEN\b`), never the whole field, and never a bare substring.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A discriminator that only emits on FAILURE cannot confirm success
- The rule going forward: **when choosing a liveness signal, ask which branch emits it. If the only emitter is the failure path, the signal cannot distinguish "working" from "never ran" — the two produce identical silence.** Put the proof on the path you expect to take, not on the one you are trying to eliminate. Direct sibling of "confirm an instrument can emit non-zero before believing its zero"; that entry covered a zero, this one covers a total absence, which is worse because nothing appears at all.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A watcher's LABEL must be entailed by its exit CONDITION
- The rule going forward: **the words a monitor prints are a claim; write them from the condition that fired, not from the outcome you are hoping for.** Before trusting a watcher's verdict, re-read the branch that produced it. Any word in the label that does not correspond to a term in the predicate is editorial.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — "Pushed to origin" is not "applied to production"
- The rule going forward: **for `render.yaml`, "on origin" and "in effect" are two different measurements, and only the second one matters. Read the live service's `/v1/services/<id>/env-vars` and compare counts before recording a config change as shipped.** The CLAUDE.md warning that a push applies to production is about the *risk* that a sync fires; it is not a guarantee that one *has*. Both errors are available, in opposite directions.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — FORBIDDEN: never edit a file from a read taken earlier in the session
- The rule going forward: **before editing any file, re-read it, and read the config that dispatches to it.** A hook, handler or entrypoint is defined by what invokes it, not by its filename. On a shared tree the gap between reading and editing is a race, and `Write` silently resurrects a deletion rather than failing — a deleted file and a file you have not re-read are indistinguishable from the editor's side.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — The enforcement layer cannot protect itself, and a lane is one deletable line
- The rule going forward: **`lanes.md` is executable configuration, not documentation, and it is edited by hand by several sessions at once.** After ANY concurrent-session ledger edit, re-run the guard over the files that matter rather than trusting the file to still say what it said. The cheap check is one line: `awk '/^### /{h=$0} /<path>/{print h}' .syndicate/lanes.md` — if a file's nearest preceding header is not the lane you expect, the block is orphaned. And harness work needs either a stated exemption in the protocol or a real lane; three sessions deciding it individually is how the one collision that mattered happened.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A FAILED READ RENDERS AS A RESULT. Five instances, one session, five different tools
- The rule going forward: **before believing a negative result from a one-off check, run the positive control.** Grep for something you KNOW is in the file; if that also returns 0, the probe is broken, not the world. It costs one command and it caught nothing this session only because it was skipped. Corollary: `grep -c` on a pipeline whose upstream can fail is not a count, it is a count-or-zero. Check the upstream exit status, or query a way that cannot silently produce an empty stream.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — The stale-read rule failed on its second application, in a form it did not cover
- The FORBIDDEN entry above ("never edit a file from a read taken earlier in the session") was written after a rewrite of a file that had been deleted. **Within the same session it was broken again**, differently: a defect was REPORTED against `lane-guard.py` — "`memory-guard-reclaimable` is unguarded, its status parses as DEPLOYED" — derived by running a copy of `LANE_RE` lifted from a read taken ~2h earlier. `559d353d` had already replaced that regex, and its comment names that lane as the motivating case. The claim was false when written, and it was published to `state.md`, where a parallel session could have acted on it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A guard has TWO failure directions, and fixing the loud one is where the silent one survives
- The rule going forward: **a guard's scope and its witness must have the same granularity.** Per-session denominator + global witness is not a fix, it is the same hole rotated — and rotated toward the silent direction. Whenever a guard is narrowed, ask what else can satisfy it, not just what it now counts. Concretely: **when fixing a guard that fails in one direction, write the test for the opposite direction in the same pass**, and for anything on a shared tree that means a two-actor test — one fixture where a second session's action is what changes your verdict. A single-actor fixture suite cannot express the failure that matters here, however many cases it has.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — Cite the SHA that will exist on origin, not the one your clone minted
- The rule going forward: **write the SHA after the push, and write the one that is on `origin`.** If a commit must be referenced before it is pushed, cite the commit SUBJECT — the subject survives cherry-pick, the SHA does not. Deploy SHAs read from the Render API are already origin SHAs and are fine as they are. Session ids are visually identical to short SHAs; always prefix them with `session`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — MY OWN DISPLAY TRUNCATION BECAME A FINDING, AND THEN A LANE'S PREMISE
- The rule going forward: **a slice width is a property of your printout, not of the record. Never read a numeric field out of a truncated line.** When a value is load-bearing, re-fetch it untruncated and print the field, not a prefix of the message. Corollary for surprise: **the more a datum overturns the expected answer, the more it must be re-read at full width before being written down** — surprise is the signal to verify, not to publish.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A BROKEN GUARD CAN MASK THE REAL PROBLEM. Fixing it is how you find out
- The rule going forward: **when a guard is found to be reading the wrong quantity, do not assume the alarms it raised were all false. Re-derive what the CORRECT quantity was doing over the same window.** Had `anon` been read on the `#417` samples with the same care as `inactive_file`, the flat +18.9MB would have been noticed as the thing that made `#417` bookkeeping — and its later non-flatness would have been the leak, visible hours earlier.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — Symptom relief resets the clock that would have proved the cause
- The rule going forward: **before restarting to clear a symptom, capture the series that proves the cause** — here, `anon` over time, which is one log query. A restart is not neutral: it is the deletion of the measurement. Record the pre-restart numbers in the row, not just "restarted, recovered".
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — Check whether the obvious fix was already tried, BEFORE building an instrument
- The rule going forward: **before instrumenting a known-hard problem, read what the codebase already says about it.** The answer to "don't we need a flush" was 50 lines of measured prose in `memory_observability.py`. An hour of sampler-building preceded finding it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — I RETRACTED POINT-SAMPLING, THEN BUILT A HEADLINE ON IT ANYWAY
- The rule going forward: **when you retract a METHOD, re-audit every live conclusion that used it, not just the instrument that exposed it.** A retraction is not local to the tool that failed; it is a statement about a class of evidence. Grep your own ledger for numbers derived the same way before the retraction goes in.

### 2026-08-13 — A habit that fails silently needs a tool, not more care
- The rule going forward: **when the same mistake recurs and its signature is indistinguishable from success, stop resolving to be careful and change the shape of the operation.** `scripts/push_via_worktree.py` resolves every SHA in the main repo BEFORE a worktree exists, and treats an empty payload as a hard error naming that exact cause. The class of bug is now unreachable rather than merely watched for.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A TROUGH THAT CLEARS AN EARLIER PEAK IS A RATCHET. That is the test
- What we believed, three times in one evening, each time on the evidence available: (1) refresh-worker leaks ~300MB/hour [from two point samples]; (2) no leak is established, it may be a 1550MB oscillation [after measuring the within-window spread]; (3) the leak is real at ~+1200MB/hour [after 45 minutes of floor series].
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — I RE-READ THE DEPLOYED SHA BEFORE EVERY *READ* AND SKIPPED IT BEFORE A *WRITE*
- The rule going forward: **re-read the live SHA inside the same step that deploys, and assert the target is a descendant of it.** "I checked a few minutes ago" is not a check on a repo with concurrent sessions. A deploy tool should refuse when `merge-base --is-ancestor <live> <target>` fails — that single assertion turns this class of accident into an error message.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A "PURE READ" endpoint is a reader you will not find by grepping the attach
- The rule going forward: **when a fix's observable is served by an endpoint, ask what BUILDS the payload that endpoint returns, not which functions mutate it.** For anything artifact-backed the answer is usually a different service, and "the code is deployed" then says nothing about the reading. Find the readers from the DATA (who writes this artifact, who reads it) rather than from the function name.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A CONSTANT that reproduces exactly is a data outage, not a weak model
- The rule going forward: **before treating "every row is identical" as a modelling defect, reproduce the constant from an empty input.** If it matches exactly, the bug is upstream in data availability or file selection, and every hour spent in the model is wasted. `#377` sat OPEN and UNOWNED for days as a product decision about what a board may assert; it was a file-selection bug the whole time.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — A FIXTURE THAT OMITS A MARKER FILE TESTS A DIFFERENT DIRECTORY, AND SCORES IT AS A DEFECT
- The rule going forward: **a fixture that selects a resource by CONVENTION must assert which resource it actually selected, before it is allowed to render a verdict.** Concretely: print the resolved root/path/connection and compare it to the intended one, and abort if they differ. v2 does exactly that (`if resolved -ne $root { ABORT: this fixture tests nothing }`) and the guard then passed all three checks plus a positive control.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-13 — CLOSING A TICKET IS A SCOPE DECISION, AND WHOLESALE CLOSURE SILENTLY RETIRES THE PART NOBODY WORKED
- The rule going forward: **before closing a ticket, enumerate its distinct claims and resolve each one separately. Any claim without evidence gets carved out into its own ticket, with a forward reference from the closure, BEFORE the parent is marked closed.** A ticket is not an atom; long entries in this repo routinely accrete a second and third finding under the original headline, and the accreted ones are the least likely to have an owner.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A PLATEAU IS A STRONGER SIGNAL THAN A PERCENTAGE
- **The rule going forward: when attributing growth, look for what STOPS growing, not for what is large.** A percentage describes one instant and can be high for uninteresting reasons; a plateau against a rising total is a structural statement and needs no threshold to interpret. Same shape as the trough-vs-earlier-peak test recorded hours earlier — both replace "how big is it" with "what does it do over time", and both settled a question that a single number had left ambiguous twice.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — I MEASURED A STAGE WITHOUT THE THING THAT DOMINATES IT, AND ALMOST SHIPPED THE FIX
- The rule going forward: **before quoting a measurement, ask which input dominates and whether the run contained it.** A partial run does not produce a smaller version of the answer — it produces a different answer wearing the same units. Coverage is not a confidence interval on the number; it decides whether the number is about the thing at all.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A guard's floor is a claim about ONE stage; refusing everything downstream of it is a separate bug
- **The rule going forward: a memory floor is a claim about the cost of ONE stage. Before putting a guard in front of a span, enumerate what is inside the span and what each part costs. If the span contains work an order of magnitude cheaper than the floor, the guard is not protecting that work — it is deleting it.** The cheap work needs its own, measured floor, and the abort line needs to say WHICH floor fired or the two become indistinguishable in the logs.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A CADENCE IS NOT AN OUTAGE, AND I ESCALATED ONE AS THE OTHER
- What I believed, and told the user in bold: MLB odds "have not been refetched since 8:09am CDT, now 2h10m and counting", framed as a capture stall worth chasing. I had two independent readings 78 minutes apart showing the freshest observation frozen at the *identical* instant, which felt decisive.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A CONSTANT THAT REPRODUCES EXACTLY FROM AN EMPTY INPUT IS A DATA OUTAGE, NOT A WEAK MODEL
- The rule going forward: **before treating "every row is identical" as a modelling defect, reproduce the constant from an empty input.** If it matches, the bug is upstream in data availability or file selection and every hour spent in the model is wasted.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A LANE LEFT OPEN AFTER ITS WORK SHIPS IS AN ACTIVE LOCK, NOT A STALE NOTE
- The rule going forward: **close a lane when its measurement lands, not at checkpoint.** The ledger already treats an unmeasured deploy as an open obligation; an unclosed lane is worse, because it also blocks other people.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — `git add <paths>` SCOPES THE INDEX; ONLY A PATHSPEC ON `commit` SCOPES THE COMMIT
- The rule going forward: **on a shared tree, always `git commit -- <paths>`.** Check `git diff --cached --name-only` BEFORE committing and the commit's `--stat` AFTER. And note the argument order: `-m`/`-F` must come BEFORE the `--`, or git reads the message as a pathspec.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — DECOMPOSE BIAS BEFORE PUBLISHING A SKILL VERDICT
- The rule going forward: **before writing any skill verdict, subtract the mean error and re-score.** Report `mae_model`, `mae_constant_baseline` AND `mae_debiased` together. A model that beats the baseline only after de-biasing is a calibration ticket, not a dead model, and the three numbers side by side are what make that legible. MAE alone cannot separate them.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A GUARD MUST COUNT THE ROWS THE STATISTIC USES, NOT THE ROWS THE JOIN PRODUCED
- The rule going forward: **a guard's denominator must be the denominator of the thing it is guarding.** If a statistic is computed over a subset, the gate counts the subset. Print BOTH — "361 joined, 9 with a projection" — because the gap between them is itself the finding: here it was the whole story (a column added 13 days earlier), not a footnote to a skill result.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — THREE wrong root causes in one session, one shape: a single sample of a moving quantity
- The rule going forward: **before concluding from an absence or a single reading, ask "what is the period of this thing?" and take a span longer than it — or read the durable state instead of the event stream.** And when a finding rests on a constant, read the whole comment AND the call sites of the function that owns it before publishing; the disconfirming sentence was already written in the file all three times.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — I CALLED A CORRELATION A PROOF, TWICE IN ONE SESSION
- What I believed: the soccer odds gap was step truncation. The evidence felt airtight — the pregame run is 50 steps grouped by kind, odds sit at #21-30 behind ten sims, and the fresh/dark split matched the step order with **no exceptions**: `soccer_eredivisie_odds` #27 current, #28/#29/#30 all 3.6 days stale. I wrote "ROOT CAUSE PROVEN" into the lane, shipped a reorder, and told the user it was the fix.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A HEALTHY-LOOKING SIBLING MASKED A PLATFORM-WIDE OUTAGE
- What we believed, for most of a session: three soccer leagues had a broken odds capture while eredivisie was fine. The contrast WAS the evidence — same script, same key, same region, one works — and it drove three successive hypotheses (season gate, step truncation, per-league fetch fault), two of which were shipped against.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A fallback CHAIN has a rung that fires; find it before costing the fix
- The rule going forward: **when a defect is described as "it falls back to X", the fix is worthless until you know which rung actually fires.** Removing the last rung of a chain whose third rung always fires is an inert fix that will be reported as shipped. Enumerate the chain, find who writes each key upstream, and exercise the function once per shape before estimating impact or urgency.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A MANGLED SHELL ARGUMENT NEARLY BECAME "THE LEDGER LOST MY WORK"
- What I believed for about ninety seconds: the retraction and root cause I had just pushed were NOT on `origin/main`. Four greps, all returning 0, against files I had verified before pushing.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A watcher that compares TIMESTAMPS to identify a thing will misidentify it by microseconds
- The rule going forward: **to answer "is this still the same thing", compare the IDENTITY, not a timestamp derived from it.** The fix was one line — check the deploy's commit SHA against the SHA the window opened on. A timestamp is a measurement of an event; the SHA IS the event. Identity comparisons do not have precision, and precision is where this class of bug lives.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — I PREDICTED FILE OWNERSHIP INSTEAD OF PROBING IT, TWICE
- What I believed, twice, and wrote into a checkpoint as a blocker: that `scripts/refresh_odds_sources.py` and then `scripts/run_live_odds_refresh_worker.py` were claimed by other OPEN lanes and would need a reassignment before I could touch them. The second one was handed to the next session as "needs a lane reassignment or their owner".
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — PINNED DEPLOYS PUT CODE IN PRODUCTION THAT WAS NEVER ON MAIN
- What I believed at three consecutive checkpoints: everything I had shipped was on `origin/main`. I had verified the ledger content each time, and the reorder commit, and reported "all content is on origin".
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — Separating `add` from `commit` is not enough if you chain them with `&&`
- The rule going forward: **the inspection must be its own tool call, with the commit in a LATER call.** And prefer the pathspec form, which makes the index state irrelevant:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A saturated log window proves nothing, and the untouched sibling is the control
- The rule going forward: **when you suspect a change caused a symptom, find the sibling that did NOT get the change and look there first.** A same-config, same-moment, untouched service settles causation in one query, while before/after windows on the affected service can be silently truncated. Corollary: **a log window that returns exactly `limit` rows is evidence of nothing absent** — re-query narrower until it comes back under the cap, or count POSITIVE markers (`PUBLISH_OK`) instead, which a tail cannot hide.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A regex over a hand-written ledger inverts "NOT claimed" into "claimed"
- The rule going forward: **`lanes.md` is prose written for humans, and the negations are load-bearing. Do not derive a claim set from a regex over it.** If a lane's claims matter — for a collision check, a census, or an accusation — read the block. The cheap guard: any extracted claim list should be re-checked against the lines containing `NOT claimed`, `Collision`, `elsewhere`, or `held by` before it is used.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — An audit's CAUSAL claim is a hypothesis; its MEASUREMENT is evidence
- The rule going forward: **an audit's measurements and its explanations have different evidentiary status.** "28px of overflow at 1440" is a reading and survives being handed on; "because the grid does not stack" is the auditor's inference and must be re-derived by whoever acts on it. Before editing the rule an audit names, confirm that rule currently produces the symptom — the cheap version is one `getComputedStyle`/`getBoundingClientRect` on the element, which takes a minute and would have caught this.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — A COUNT can rise because the population grew, not because the property got worse
- The rule going forward: **when a count changes across a fix, check whether the fix changed what is being counted.** A raw count carries an implicit denominator — here "tabs that exist" — and a change that adds members makes the count move on its own. Report it as a rate, or report the denominator beside it, or the next reader files a regression that does not exist.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — An audit brief's "known already" inputs are claims, not axioms
- The rule going forward: **spend the first ten minutes of any audit re-verifying the inputs it tells you not to re-derive.** An input marked "known" is the one nobody will check, which is exactly why a stale one propagates. Cheap to test, and a single dead citation invalidates every downstream count that assumed it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — the Render logs API returns the NEWEST N in a window; paging forward silently reports a peak over a sliver
- I wrote a pager that walked a time window by advancing `startTime` past the last line of each page. The API does not work that way: it returns the newest `limit` lines inside `[startTime, endTime]`, presented oldest-first (`deploy_preflight. newest_log`'s own docstring says so and I did not read it). Advancing startTime re-reads the same tail and terminates.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — a before/after is void if the change moved work INSIDE the measured span
- The `#387` streaming cutover was measured as "peak anon during `OVERVIEW_SPORT_BEGIN mlb` -> pass end". The change also moves per-sport candidate collection INTO that pass. So the after-span contains work the before-span did not, and "peak went UP" is partly definitional, not behavioural.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

### 2026-08-14 — "it cannot fit" from one sample, when the same shape runs fine twice
- A handoff carried, as its single next action, a fix whose justification was one OOM: eight sports hydrated at once, "peak = SUM is sufficient on its own to cross 4GiB", "the floor plays no part". I deployed it, then measured two pre-deploy passes of the IDENTICAL shape from the same evening: 8 sports hydrated, peaks 804MB and 613MB, 15-20% of the ceiling, no death.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — FORBIDDEN: never treat equality of a LABEL as identity of a BET

- **The rule going forward:** every memory number carries a SCOPE — container, process, or thread — and only same-scope numbers may be subtracted. Write the scope next to the figure. `memory.current`/`anon` and `oomKilled` are container; `smaps`, `PYMALLOC_STATS`, `HEAP_CENSUS`, `mallinfo` and `getsizeof` are process; a container with children makes them differ by hundreds of MB.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — FORBIDDEN: never deploy on `check_deploy_safety.py` alone. It said CLEAR while three jobs were running on the service.

## 2026-08-15 — FORBIDDEN: never read a joiner zero as a fact about the world until the reader is shown to SEE the data

- **What happened.** The rule was written in advance, in good faith, and was wrong. `same_book_n=0` came back for all 8 sports. The truth: `/api/ops/clv/report` runs on **web**, `load_openings` is a `path.exists()` on a local file, and web held **0 bytes** of the ledger while refresh-worker had **490 openings recorded for that same date**. The endpoint returned `ok: true` throughout. Shipping one allowlist line moved `same_book_n` **0 → 144** with **no change to odds history at all**. Breadth constrains `resolved` (`no_market_in_history: 172`), never `same_book_n`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — FORBIDDEN: shipping a verification you have not falsified. THREE failed checks in one night, zero failed fixes

- **The rule.** Before arming any check, ask the falsification question about the CHECK, not the fix: *what reading would this produce if the fix worked perfectly?* If that equals the failure reading, the check is broken. Then:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — FORBIDDEN: `git <cmd> <rev>:<dotpath>` in Git Bash on Windows. It silently reads the WRONG thing, and only for dot-prefixed trees

- **The part that makes it dangerous: it is selective.** Measured:

## Superseded on 2026-08-15 — the two `same_book_n` entries

Both were merged into **"never read a joiner zero as a fact about the world"**
above; full original text is in `learnings_evidence.md`. They reappeared here
once after being removed — a stale-read write on this shared file resurrected
them alongside their own replacement. If they show up a third time, delete
them again rather than assuming the merge was reverted: the merged rule and
the evidence file are the source of truth.

### 2026-08-16 — verify a watcher's FIRST line, or it will report failure as patience

- **What we believed:** a background poller was waiting for a deploy window. It
  printed a line every 30s and looked like it was working.
- **What was actually true:** it failed on its FIRST poll and every one after —
  90 identical `RENDER_API_KEY not set in the environment or .env` lines over 45
  minutes. It never once read the gate. The key was present in `.env`; the
  PowerShell background environment could not resolve it, while the same command
  from Bash worked.
- **How we found out:** the owner asked whether it had deployed. Nothing in the
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

### 2026-08-16 — do not rebase onto a deploy target that has not shipped

- **What we believed:** rebasing onto `c70eeff0` — the SHA a claim holder had
  DECLARED as their target — would put the commit ahead of production and stop
  it going stale again.
- **What was actually true:** they shipped something else. Live went to
  `57a437d5`, which does not contain `c70eeff0`, so the rebased commit would
  have **ROLLED PRODUCTION BACK** had it been deployed.
- **How we found out:** an explicit ancestry check before deploying —
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <live> <mine>` — not the deploy tool refusing.
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

### 2026-08-16 — A DEPLOY HAS TWO LAGS IN SERIES. I GUARDED ONE AND MISREAD THE SYSTEM THREE TIMES

`deploy -> snapshot -> artifact`. live-odds-worker's tick rewrites the snapshot;
refresh-worker's build turns it into the artifact you read. **A fresh artifact
can carry a stale snapshot**, so "generated_at is after the deploy" is NOT
sufficient to conclude the number reflects the new code.

Three failures tonight, all one shape — comparing a number to an event without
establishing the number was PRODUCED AFTER the event:

1. **Warm-up read as regression.** 5 and 8 minutes after the fix landed,
   `index_size` was 0 twice. I called it a persistent regression and **asked for

### 2026-08-16 — I HELD A CLAIM ONCE AND THEN DEPLOYED OVER SOMEONE ELSE'S, TWICE

At 23:42 another session's deploy cancelled mine one second apart, and I wrote
up the deploy claim as advisory. Then `clamp-fix-to-workers` acquired
live-odds-worker at ~00:34 — and **my 00:47 rollback and 00:58 re-deploy both
fired on that service without re-checking the claim.** I did to them exactly
what had just been done to me, while holding the ledger entry about it.

**Acquiring a claim is not honouring one.** The claim I took at 23:39 gave me a
sense of ownership that outlived the claim itself; I never re-read it, and it
had moved. **Check the claim IMMEDIATELY BEFORE EVERY FIRE, not once at the
- *Full working in `learnings_evidence.md` under this heading.*

## 2026-08-16 — FORBIDDEN: never read a deploy claim's `target` as a statement about what is running

- **Measured 2026-08-15/16 on live-odds-worker.** Its claim advertised `target=49797f4b`, and `49797f4b` genuinely carried the clamp fix — verified by reading the code, not just counting a grep. I concluded twice, in writing, that the service "needs nothing".
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — RULE: merge in the object database when the shared tree is dirty

- **The rule going forward:** on this repo a reconcile does **not** need a checkout. `git merge-tree --write-tree` + temp index + `commit-tree` + `push <sha>:main` merges with **zero** working-tree writes, so concurrent sessions' edits cannot be refused, overwritten, or staged by accident.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-15 — RULE: resolve a ledger conflict by REPLACING the stale entry, never by appending

- **The rule going forward:** when both sides changed a lane, the merge is not "keep both" — a union leaves the file **asserting two contradictory statuses** for one slug and nothing flags it. Find the slug's other occurrence and overwrite the stale header in place; demote the old body to marked history.

- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — RULE: fix a bad commit MESSAGE by rebuilding the commit from its own tree, not by `--amend` and not by living with it

- **What we believed:** the shared-tree recipe offered two options for a wrong commit message — `git commit --amend -- <paths>` (dangerous: without a pathspec it commits the whole shared index, and it once swallowed another session's 22 staged files) or *"accept the message and move on."* Written as a binary, so a message defect looked like something you either risk a disaster over or simply eat.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — a per-row field read off ONE row and generalised to all of them

- **Overturned:** my own same-day claim that "every exercised `win_prob` run is on an OLDER commit", which I wrote into `deploys.md` and `state.md` and pushed, along with a discriminator ("one `rows>0` on a current commit") for resolving it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — OVERTURNED: a pinned SHA identifies deployed CODE

- **The belief.** Two scheduled measurement tasks pinned their comparison with "if the live SHA is no longer `d72d670c`, the comparison is invalid — a different SHA may have reverted the fixes." That reads as rigour. It is a string equality test standing in for a question about content.

## 2026-08-16 — a mirrored row set makes a wrong join look like a UNIFORM defect, which is the most convincing kind.

- **What happened.** To verify an edge-attribution fix before deploying, I fetched the real served payloads, filtered to the exact rows that were serving a blank `Edge` with no reason, and ran the changed helper over them. Result: **287 of 287 attributed, 0 unattributed.** I wrote that into `deploys.md` as the verification and deployed.

- **What happened:** an isolated-index commit of 3 ledger files produced a commit of **14 files** that rendered every path it had not re-read as a DELETION — including this session's own `scripts/fetch_nfl_pbp.py` (0/276), `run_refresh_worker.py` (0/193) and another session's `syndicate/features/soccer/cards.py` (0/64).

- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 - FORBIDDEN: a deploy-content check must return THREE verdicts, not pass/fail. "Nothing shipped" is not "shipped wrong".

- *** THE THREE FILES DID NOT TRAVEL TOGETHER. Expect cards_error / blank board. ***

## 2026-08-16 - FORBIDDEN: never split one change across separately-deployed files and rely on TELLING the deployer. A message is not a guard.

- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 - a blob hash written into a ledger is a SNAPSHOT, not a lease.

- **re-read the blobs before cutting rather than trusting the numbers printed in it**.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — ASK-ANSWER-SUBSTANCE CHECKPOINT 2: five beliefs overturned

- **Sorting orders a pool; it does not decline to publish one.** Necessary, never sufficient. **General form: a fix aimed at the ORDER of bad output does not stop the output, and the note it leaves behind reads like a closed case.** When a past note says "fixed by ranking", check whether anything filters.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — ASK-ANSWER-SUBSTANCE CHECKPOINT 3: two more

- **The rule: when a metric moves across your change, diff the code path the metric actually reads before attributing it — to yourself OR to anyone else.** Both directions of misattribution are expensive. Claiming a regression you did not cause sends the next session hunting in the wrong file; claiming innocence you have not checked is worse. The check is one `git diff` scoped to the path, and it takes a minute.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 - FORBIDDEN: a loose join key makes a row VISIBLE. It does not make the row's values COMPARABLE. Those are two decisions and I made only one.

- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — CORRECTION: the shared index CHURNS, it does not accumulate — and staged content is not the alarm

- **Extends the same-day rule about slug-level ledger checks.** That one framed whole-file rewrites from stale in-memory copies as a `.syndicate/**` hazard. Measured three hours later: the same mechanism reverted a **source file**.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — ASK-ANSWER-SUBSTANCE CHECKPOINT 4: fixing a fix, and two bad inferences

- **The rule going forward:** a conditioning variable must be derivable from observable state ALONE. When a payload mixes state and prediction, split them explicitly and say so on the record. **The test for this is cheap and worth writing:** assert the model's field names are absent from the shape.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — FORBIDDEN: deploying `main`'s TREE to a service that runs a curated deploy branch

- **The tell is per-file, and it is cheap:** for each conflicted path compute `live-only` and `main-only` line counts. **`main-only == 0` means production is AHEAD there** and taking main is a revert. Measured tonight on `refresh_nba_oddsapi_props.py`, `refresh_wnba_oddsapi_props.py` and `test_win_prob_null_counter.py` — three files, on two separate services, where the obvious move was the wrong one.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — FORBIDDEN: gating a deploy on "no jobs running" for a continuously-busy worker

- **Worse, the gate measures the wrong moment.** Render BUILDS first and stops the service after (`build_started 21:13:49 -> build_ended 21:18:29 -> live 21:21:05`). What dies is whatever runs at the STOP, ~5 minutes after the trigger — not what preflight saw when you fired.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — FORBIDDEN: resolving the SAME symbolic ref in two git calls. A stale tree on a current parent is a fast-forward, and git cannot tell it from a deliberate revert.

- *(the heading states the rule; full working in `learnings_evidence.md`)*
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — FORBIDDEN: attributing an excursion with a field that is not THREAD-scoped. A process-global "last stage" names the last thread to speak, not the one allocating.

- **The rule going forward:** before concluding the DATA is wrong, scan the residual against the fitted value. Structure there indicts the model.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-16 — FORBIDDEN: instrumenting a WRAPPER when the hot path has siblings that reach the same work directly. Twice in one night.

- **The rule going forward — the recipe, because it worked and is reusable:**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: the em-dash in a lane header is SYNTAX, not punctuation. A hyphen header is an UNGUARDED lane

- **Evidence.** `wnba-fixture-identity` was opened by a live session with ASCII hyphens: `### wnba-fixture-identity - OPEN - **...`. `lane-guard.py` parses `^###\s+(\S+)\s+—\s*([^—]*)` and requires U+2014, so the header did not parse at all. Consequences, all silent: the lane's three claimed files were unguarded (one of them contended with a lane closed minutes earlier), and the session-start digest did not list the lane as OPEN, so an arriving session saw no claim on those paths. Found 2026-08-17 12:3x CDT by the `ledger-sweep` lane while verifying something else; the hook had been printing `(1 lane header(s) have no parseable status and are NOT guarded)` and nobody had read it as naming a specific live lane.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — FORBIDDEN: diagnosing from FILTERED log projections. Six wrong attributions, one question, and the answer was in the lines I was truncating.

- **Each filter encoded the hypothesis I was trying to test.** A `text=` query returns only what I already believed mattered; stripping the memory lines removed the only rows carrying `seconds_since_stage` and `climb_mb_per_s`; truncation hid the discriminating field. The phantom "third ledger pass" was a filtered window that began mid-scan and invented a caller that never existed.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: committing through an ISOLATED index ARMS the shared index with a revert of that commit. Disarm after, not just before

- **The recipe is still right; it has a second half nobody had written down.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — OVERTURNED: "a statistical win on a sim parameter can be graded by betting hit rate on the same sample"

- **Belief going in:** the overrides file records `starter_tto_quality_scaling`
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: before building a fix, check whether it was already considered and REJECTED in the code you are about to edit

- **The rule going forward:** **an override is not an override until it has been exercised through the real entry point.** For a hook, that means over stdin as a payload — not by setting the variable in the test process, which is a different environment than any user of the documented recipe will ever have. Corollary: the test that would have caught this is the one that runs the guard's own printed text verbatim. If a tool prints instructions, those instructions are an interface and belong in the suite.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: score a DISTRIBUTIONAL forecast with a distributional baseline. A point test on a distribution is the wrong instrument, even when it agrees.

- **What happened.** Phase 7's whole purpose was to build a proper scoring rule for projections (CRPS, bias/dispersion). I built it, used it to find a real defect — the MLB F5 starter leash, dispersion 1.002 vs a 0.7979 target — and then decided whether the model had SKILL by comparing its **mean absolute error to a constant point prediction**. That verdict went into `state.md`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a LEAKED backtest number is an UPPER BOUND, not merely an untrustworthy one

- **Standing practice here is to mark a leaky backtest "not citable" and stop.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a PATHSPEC commit is the default; the isolated index is the FALLBACK. The latter arms a revert every time

- **Relayed by `commit-guard-blind-to-own-recipe`, owed to and written by the coordinator.** That lane measured the two forms against a repo whose index held a revert of `A.txt` and a deletion of `C.txt`:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: never close a queue item in BULK. Close each against its own evidence

- **I did this to a live deploy request within hours of documenting the same failure shape.** After deploying three requests I moved *everything* in `.syndicate/deploy/requests/` to `done/` and stamped it all "EXECUTED by the coordinator". A fourth request (`soccer-layer2-dates`) had been filed at 20:20Z, after that batch was scoped. It was never deployed — its commits were not even pushed — and it spent that time marked delivered.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: an aggregate dispersion check cannot see an UNINFORMATIVE CENTRE

- **What happened.** Phase 7's bias/dispersion decomposition reported MLB pitcher outs at **dispersion 0.791 against a 0.798 target** — as close to perfect as that metric gets. I read it as "the shape is right, only the location is off" and went looking for a calibration fix.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a signature change needs a CALLER CENSUS, not a spot-check of the caller you just edited

- **Evidence.** `_load_team_ratings` gained a required third parameter (`as_of`, audit §7 #6). The author updated the caller inside the same module and wrote a test for it:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a falsified prediction LOCALISES a bug; treat it as a measurement, not a miss

- **Three predictions were falsified today and each was worth more than the confirmation would have been.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — A SIGNATURE CHANGE NEEDS A CALLER CENSUS, AND THE CALLER YOU CANNOT REACH IS THE ONE THAT BREAKS

- **Why it survived â€” three independent covers, and each is a general shape:**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — TEST DEPLOYMENT BY CONTENT, NEVER BY ANCESTRY OR BY A SHARED SYMBOL

- **False negative.** live-odds-worker deployed `7470939b`.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: the FIRST test for any flagged feature is "does enabling it change anything"

- **I built three inert things today.** Not three bugs — three pieces of work that existed, looked complete, passed their obvious tests, and did nothing:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a watcher that reports a PEAK of ZERO has not measured a peak. Zero samples is NO DATA, never "clean"

- **I wrote a memory watcher whose entire purpose was to catch an OOM I had predicted, and it reported `Window clean. Peak live-odds-worker memory 0.0% of 2048MB` while the service was at 85.3% and climbing.** Had I trusted it, the rollback would not have happened. It was caught only because the user asked me to check the number by hand.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: a feature can be unfed at the DATA layer, and it looks nothing like a bug

- **Standing rules here cover code that is present-but-unreachable.** This is the same failure one level down: code that IS reached, with inputs that are empty.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: rank modelling gaps by how much the dimension DISCRIMINATES, not by how complete its machinery is

- **What I did.** Researching what the MLB sim was missing, I found pitch-type effectiveness fully built — model fields, four consumption sites, a loader, a cache, a fetch tool — and **0% populated**. I ranked it "where a market beat is most likely" *because everything existed and only needed wiring*, and spent **314 network calls and ~2 hours** filling it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: you cannot add a MECHANISM to a CALIBRATED engine without re-fitting its rates

- **Measured, 2x2 factorial, 4 of 4 markets:** adding position-player substitution and pitch-type splits to the MLB sim produced a **NEGATIVE interaction, mean −0.00331**. On RBIs each feature alone helped (−0.00573, −0.00271) and together they gained almost nothing (−0.00046). **On runs, both-on was WORSE than neither.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — RULE: "the model is absent" needs a FIELD AUDIT, not a name search

- **I published a research document stating the MLB sim has "no batted-ball type model — no GB/FB/LD". It was wrong.** The model exists and `simulate.py:1120-1136` consumes it for both batter and pitcher:
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-17 — FOUR DEFECTS IN ONE SESSION SHARED ONE SHAPE: THE ERROR PATH RENDERED AS THE SYSTEM'S OWN "NOTHING HERE"

- **1.** `poll_active_leagues_for_tick` caught each league's exception into an `errors` dict and continued with no print. That dict reaches only `data/live/soccer_live_lens.json`, which is not in the publisher allowlist, so it is unreadable from web. Worse, the broken call sat behind `if live_events:` — so **only a league WITH a live match could reach it**. Silent on a quiet slate, total on a busy one. Three instruments read healthy simultaneously: the tick reported `ok: true` (because `validate_live_lens_snapshot` accepts an EMPTY games list), seven leagues wrote their files successfully, and no error appeared anywhere.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a cache with a TTL can serve EMPTINESS as authoritative

- **Measured:** 1,282 BVP cache files, every one `by_batter: {}`. I concluded twice from the file COUNT — first "the data is already collected, it just needs mapping", then "it needs a real fetch job". **Both wrong, in opposite directions.** Computing fresh returned 117-170 batter entries for 5 of 5 pitchers.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: when a claim is corrected TWICE, stop asserting and run it

- **I made FOUR wrong calls about BVP in one session, alternating direction:**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — I ALMOST REQUESTED A DEPLOY FOR SOMETHING ALREADY LIVE, AND ONLY THE BASELINE CAUGHT IT

- **What caught it was mechanical, not clever:** the deploy-request template has a `verify:` field that demands a BEFORE value, so filing it forced one fresh read. The discipline that saved this was writing down the before-number at the moment of filing rather than carrying it forward.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a bias can be the NET of two opposing errors, and fixing one is a wash

- **Measured:** the MLB engine under-produced strikeouts by **27%** (K/PA 0.179 vs 0.226). The obvious cause was the pitch-outcome mix — `base_in_play` 0.23 against a league ~0.17, `base_foul` 0.12 against ~0.18 — and correcting it lands the mix almost exactly on the league.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — A STRUCTURAL DEFECT AND A MARKET EDGE ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS

- **The market moved by −0.00013. Two markets better, two worse.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — MEASURE THE COUNT MATRIX; DO NOT GRID-SEARCH IT

- **`count_delta` is a single scalar** and structurally CANNOT express take-early / attack-middle / protect-late. No amount of search fixes a parameterisation that cannot represent the answer.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a session RESUME reassigns the session id, which silently stands the coordinator role down. The register must be re-verified, not assumed

- **My own deploy guard blocked me.** `coordinator.id` held `9ed7fd89-...` — correct when written at 13:36 — and the hook was being handed `6f0980eb-...`. Nothing edited the register; **the session id changed underneath it** when the session was resumed. The role had been silently unheld for an unknown stretch, and the first symptom was the coordinator being unable to deploy.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — THE MARKET HARNESS HAS A NOISE FLOOR 2.4x THE EFFECTS IT WAS USED TO JUDGE

- **Same configuration, two seeds, nothing else changed:**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a `sed` backreference that does not match writes a RAW CONTROL BYTE, and it ate three lane slugs

- **Three OPEN lanes lost their names entirely.** Their headers read `###  \x01  —  \x02  — **body` — the literal bytes `\x01` and `\x02` where the slug and status should be. A session correcting the ASCII-hyphen headers ran a substitution with `\1`/`\2` backreferences whose capture groups did not match, and `sed` wrote the escape sequences as raw control characters instead of the captured text.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — A DUPLICATED TERM PASSES EVERY CHECK THIS REPO HAS. A PLAUSIBILITY READ CAUGHT IT.

- **WHAT DID NOT CATCH IT — the full list, because that is the finding.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a union merge CANNOT carry a deliberate deletion. A collapse pushed through one is undone, and comes back bigger

- **I collapsed `state.md` from 59 sections to 26, pushed it through the merge cycle, and `origin/main` came out with 87.** The collapse was reverted and my new sections were added on top, so the file ended up **larger than before I started**.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — A VARIANCE-REDUCTION TRICK THAT CHANGES THE ANSWER IS NOT A VARIANCE-REDUCTION TRICK

- **The first bug, and why finding it was NOT the end.** I keyed the seed on `half.next_batter_index`, reasoning that "a team's Nth plate appearance is the same logical event in both arms." **`simulate.py:3178` advances that index MODULO the lineup length.** It holds 9 values, so the same stream replayed 4-5 times per game — scoring inflated up to **126%**. I had even written "batter_index grows monotonically (not modulo)" into the lane note; one line of code said otherwise.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a wiring gate must ask whether the payload is READ, not whether a payload is PASSED

- **Lane `football-model-owner`. Caught by measurement, one step before it would have been published as a clean result.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a zero from a LOCAL checkout is a statement about the mirror, never about production. I filed one as a defect

- **Lane `football-model-owner`. Caught by the repo's own rule, one step after I had already written the wrong claim into `todo.md` and a reference doc.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a guard that gates on IDENTITY fails to a total block when the identity holder disappears. Gate on STATE

- **The failure.** `deploy-guard.py` allowed a deploy when `session_id in .syndicate/coordinator.id`. The coordinator was a session. The session was archived. From that moment the allow-branch was **unreachable**, and the guard blocked every deploy from every session — while presenting itself as a routing rule ("file a request, carry on"). Two requests sat in `deploy/requests/`, `deploy/grants/` was empty, and an 11-day clock ran on the NCAAF opener. Nobody had disabled anything; the predicate simply stopped having a true value.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — CHECK WHETHER A FIELD EXISTS BEFORE DECLARING IT

- **No error, no warning, no test failure.** The symptom was that an override dict of 1.0s produced different results from an empty dict.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — OVERTURNED: "the ledger files were fine, just big" — session `football-model-owner`

- **What was believed.** The session-start digest measured `LEDGER OVER BUDGET`
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — OVERTURNED: "a guard that is present is a guard that is working" — session `football-model-owner`

- **Two instances in one session, on two different hooks.**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — FORBIDDEN: never apply a transform to a shared file by patching the transform's own source with `str.replace` — session `football-model-owner`

- **What happened.** To re-run a collapse against the WORKING copy instead of `HEAD`, I rewrote the script's input line with `str.replace` and `exec`'d it. The replacement DID NOT MATCH — whitespace differed — so the "worktree rebuild" silently re-ran the HEAD version, and writing the result destroyed another session's 31 uncommitted lines, including a deployed-and-measured NCAAF result.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: before wiring ANY feature into a model, check whether the feature is computed FROM THE THING BEING PREDICTED. Ask what WINDOW it covers, not what it is named.

- *(the heading states the rule; full working in `learnings_evidence.md`)*
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — A TRUNCATED READING IS NOT A COMPLETE ONE

- **RULE: before reporting a null or an absence, prove the query can return a non-null.** A control that must succeed. `pattern=*conditional_mix*` returns count:1 where `pattern=conditional_mix_2026.json` returns count:0 for the SAME file — and I ran the bad form five times and quoted it to two other sessions.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — A STALE-BUT-"RUNNING" SESSION IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY ORPHAN CHECK

- **It survived BOTH checks, for opposite reasons:**
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a session worktree protects your INDEX, not your EDIT. Shared-file carry is not absorption.

- The rule going forward: **not scoped to ledger files — confirmed 2026-08-19 on two plain hook-script docstrings.** Expect the next session that commits the shared tree to carry ANY uncommitted edit sitting in the working copy, and expect an UNCOMMITTED edit to be destroyed outright if it conflicts. Commit it with a PATHSPEC commit (`git commit <paths> -m ...`, no staging) the moment it is written, or at minimum re-check `git diff --cached` / `git log -1 -- <path>` before assuming an edit is still pending — a carried edit shows a clean diff and a commit you did not make. Attribution is not worth defending; LOSS is the only thing to check.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-18 — RULE: a check that answers a SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT question returns a confident wrong answer. Six in one session.

- The rule going forward: **before believing a surprising reading, state what the command actually compared.** Every one of these was a real command, exiting 0, returning a plausible number — and answering a question adjacent to the one asked. None failed loudly. The tell is always the same: a result that would be *convenient* or *alarming* if true, produced by a check nobody restated in words first.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: no active owner, no claims. And a liveness read EXPIRES.

- The rule going forward: **a lane whose owning session is archived, absent from the roster, or silent for hours MUST NOT hold file claims.** Releasing claims is NOT closing the lane — its findings stand and it can be reopened. Audit the full claim set against the roster **including archived**, because `include_archived: false` hides exactly the evidence the question needs.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — CORRECTION: the PATHSPEC commit does NOT cover a NEW file. Staging is still the race, and it bit.

- The rule going forward: **`git commit -- <paths>` only works on paths git already knows. A brand-new file MUST be `git add`ed first, and that add-to-commit window is exactly the race the pathspec form was adopted to remove.** For a new file on a shared tree, either commit it from your own worktree, or accept that it may be carried into another session's commit and verify by CONTENT afterwards.

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: before building a feature pipeline for an unwired input, check whether the engine has a BETTER-WIRED input already doing that job

- **Evidence.** `smartsim2` reads 33 alias-terms from `feature_generation_payload` and no production entrypoint passes it. I measured that wiring it changed the output, then spent a session building a leak-free as-of feature pipeline for it.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a population checklist CANNOT detect leakage, and a large clean first-wiring effect is a leakage SUSPECT

- **Evidence.** `build_nflverse_game_metrics` computes EPA from the game being predicted. **r = 0.988** against the final margin over 285 games.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a small-n result is not a preview of the large-n result. It is the artifact.

- **Evidence, one metric, one session:**

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a repair pass must be constrained to EXTEND, never SUBSTITUTE. And a mid-flight hook protects only new sessions.

- The rule going forward: **when automating a fix across N items, the safety condition is a property of the REPLACEMENT RELATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL — "the new text must START WITH the old" — not a property of the source you pulled it from.** "The evidence file has a rule line" is not "this is the SAME line, longer", and the gap between those two clobbered 18 lines that existed nowhere else.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RETRACTION: "a mid-flight hook protects only new sessions" is WRONG. Hooks fire per call. The real hole is BASH.

- The rule going forward: **hooks are evaluated on every tool call, not cached at session start — a newly registered guard IS in force immediately, including for sessions that started before it existed. But a PreToolUse guard matched on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit` is BLIND to writes made through Bash**, and in this repo that is not an edge case: `trim_lane_blocks.py`, `hoist_open_lanes.py` and `compact_learnings.py` all write ledger files from Bash by design.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — VERIFY THE CHANNEL, NOT JUST THE QUERY

- **It could never appear there.** `live_refresh_loop.py:2784-2790` spawns the sim job with `popen_kwargs["stdout"] = open(log_path, "wb")` — every line the wrapper prints goes to a FILE on the worker's disk, never to the container stdout Render collects.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a guard that fails open silently is indistinguishable from a guard that works. Grep for the symbol you deleted.

- The rule going forward: **after editing a guard, prove it still FIRES — do not accept "it parses" or "it is registered" as evidence.** Every hook here wraps its work in `except Exception: return 0` so a broken guard cannot block real work, which means a broken guard is also SILENT. Those two properties are the same line of code.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a threshold raise buys HEADROOM ÷ GROWTH RATE. Compute it, or you are choosing a fix you have not measured.

- The rule going forward: **before raising a limit instead of fixing what fills it, divide the new headroom by the observed growth rate and say the answer out loud in hours.** If that number is smaller than the interval between the people who would act on it, the raise is not a fix, it is a snooze — and it costs the credibility of the threshold as well as the time.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: "this cannot be automated" is a claim like any other. Name the predicate you tried.

- The rule going forward: **before concluding something is not enforceable, state the specific predicate you tested and why it fails. If you cannot name one, you have described the first idea you had, not the problem.** The useful move is almost always to narrow the target: not "detect appending", but "detect the one SHAPE of appending that causes the damage".
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: exonerated as the CAUSE is not free of DEFECTS. Re-ask the narrower question.

- The rule going forward: **when a suspect is cleared of causing the symptom you were chasing, ask separately whether it is nonetheless broken.** An exoneration answers one question — "did this cause X" — and it is routinely read as answering a bigger one, "is this fine". Those come apart, and the second question is cheap to ask once you are already looking at the thing.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — CORRECTION: shared-file carry reaches plain files too, and it reads as nothing to commit, not as loss

- The rule going forward: **`git diff --cached` (or plain `git diff`) coming back EMPTY on a file you know you just edited means the edit already landed in someone else's commit — check before concluding there is nothing to do.** Two hook-script docstrings (`.claude/hooks/ledger-commit-guard.py`, `ledger-postwrite-check.py`, not `.syndicate/*.md`) were fixed here, left uncommitted pending the user's go-ahead, then swept into a parallel `github-actions[bot]` checkpoint commit (`f5953d4c`) before this session staged them. `git log -1 -- <path>` then `git blame -L <line>,<line> <path>` named the commit and confirmed the exact content in two calls. Cost was zero — the fix is correct and already on `origin/main` — but the intended atomic, reviewable two-file commit never existed as such; it rode inside an unrelated bundle. Broadens the 2026-08-18 "shared-file carry is not absorption" rule above: the mechanism is not ledger-specific, it is anything sitting uncommitted in the one shared working tree.
- *(evidence in `learnings_evidence.md`)*

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: read the convention off the DIRECTORY before restructuring it. The precedent is usually already on disk.

- The rule going forward: **before splitting, renaming or re-keying a set of
  files, look at how the EXISTING members are keyed and confirm your rule
  reproduces them.** If your scheme would have filed yesterday's files
  differently than they are actually filed, your scheme is wrong -- the existing
  layout is the specification.

**MEASURED, and reverted within the hour.** Asked to split an 87 KB daily log, I
moved 7 entries stamped `2026-08-19 ...Z` into a new `log/2026-08-19.md`. The
repo keys these files to the **LOCAL** date, so UTC stamps rolling past midnight
stay in the local day's file. **The proof was two directory entries away and I
read it afterwards:** `2026-08-16.md` contains 5 headings stamped 08-17,
`2026-08-17.md` contains 4 stamped 08-18. A single `grep` over a sibling file,
before the change, would have settled it.

**THE COST WAS DISCOVERABILITY, which is what a log is FOR.** A session looking
for "what happened tonight" opens the local-date file; my checkpoints would have
been missing from it while sitting in a file for a day that had not started
locally. Nothing was lost and the error was cheap only because it was caught fast.

**THE REVERT HAD ITS OWN TRAP.** Another session appended to the log between the
split and the revert, so restoring the pre-split backup would have destroyed
their work. Entries were APPENDED BACK instead, accepting approximate ordering
within the day. **On a shared file, "undo" is not "restore the backup".**

**What survived the mistake, because it was measured rather than assumed:** a
single chronological cut is unsafe here (an 08-18 entry sits after the first
08-19 one, so the file is not strictly time-ordered), and splitting on `###`
shreds entries (40 of 46 blocks are undated sub-sections of a parent). Both
findings stand; only the day-key was wrong.

## 2026-08-19 — RULE: a mass-deletion diff is not self-explaining. Compare DISTINCT lines before accepting "it was just dedupe".

- The rule going forward: **when a diff you did not intend shows large deletions,
  do not reason from the line COUNTS or from a plausible story about
  reformatting. Take the set difference of DISTINCT lines, both directions, and
  then grep the tree for a sample of what is missing.** Counts cannot separate
  "500 duplicate copies removed" from "500 unique records deleted", and those are
  the same number.

**MEASURED.** A stray `git add -A` on the shared tree swept another session's
in-progress rewrite of two day-logs into my commit: 1,087 insertions, 1,173
deletions. **My first read was "deduplication of union-merge blocks"** -- the
removed samples were generic repeated headings (`### VERIFIED`, `### Lane`),
which is exactly what dedupe looks like, and the file did contain "MERGED FROM
origin/main -- block-level union" sections. Comfortable, plausible, wrong.
Distinct-line comparison showed **498 and 440 lines gone ENTIRELY**, including
whole session records; a grep confirmed they existed nowhere on disk.

**THE DISCRIMINATOR IS CHEAP AND THE STORY IS FREE.** `set(before) - set(after)`
takes one line to write. The dedupe story took no evidence at all and would have
closed the investigation.

**RESTORING NEEDED A UNION, NOT A REVERT.** The swept version also contained
1,087 lines of genuine new work, so neither version was a superset: reverting
would have destroyed their additions, keeping would have destroyed the history.
**When both sides of an accidental overwrite contain unique content, the only
non-destructive repair is a block-level union**, verified in BOTH directions --
0 distinct lines missing from either side.

**Related:** the rule against `git add -A` on a shared tree was already recorded
and I had followed it all session, using pathspec commits specifically to avoid
this. I reached for `-A` because the change spanned three files instead of one.
**A rule you keep for the easy case and drop for the slightly harder one is not
a rule you have.**
