### #394 — hash guard
- Deployed: 2026-08-12 20:26
- Change: compare the computed checksum instead of merely sending it, so
  unchanged artifacts are skipped rather than re-uploaded.
- Expected: sharp drop in redundant uploads per sweep.
- Measured: logging skips as intended. **Egress impact not isolated —
  deployed close to #395.** `[partial]`
- Rollback: revert #394
- Verdict: shipped, effect not cleanly attributed.

### #395 — rate ceiling
- Deployed: 2026-08-12
- Change: caps worst-case egress at 2 GB/hr per service.
- Expected: hard ceiling on blast radius, not a fix.
- Measured: `<pending>`
- Rollback: revert #395
- Verdict: mitigation, not remediation. Do not treat a flat graph under
  this cap as evidence the underlying issue is solved.

### Baseline measurement — first-byte sample
- Date: 2026-08-12
- n=29 uploads, 86.2 MB total. Min 325 B, median ~73 KB, max 11.6 MB.
- Read: highly skewed — bytes concentrated in a few large artifacts.
  Any fix must be evaluated on total bytes, not upload count.

### `#417`/`#387` — guard on unreclaimable memory
- Deployed: 2026-08-13 12:57 CDT (`17:57:53Z`), refresh-worker
  `srv-d91dpertqb8s73co8ls0`, deploy `dep-d9v0b8bncjis73an78hg`,
  commit **`03073270`**, trigger `api`.
- Preceded by: `/preflight` FAIL -> remediated. `check_deploy_safety.py`
  CLEAR at 12:53, 12:54 and 12:57 (MLB sim finished exit=0, odds refresh
  idle). Standing caveat accepted: **live games were in progress**, so
  live-lens ticks and live prop hydration took an interruption.
- Change: `memory_headroom_snapshot` decides on `max - unreclaimable`, where
  unreclaimable is `max(anon + shmem + slab_unreclaimable,
  current - reclaimable_file)` and `reclaimable_file` now includes
  `active_file`. Replaces `(max - current) + inactive_file +
  slab_reclaimable`, under which a kernel LRU promotion moved the verdict
  ~243MB with no change in memory pressure.
- **One substantive change.** Deployed at `03073270` rather than at the
  `origin/main` tip deliberately: the tip also carries another session's
  `live_refresh_loop.py` work (`#419`/`#420`), which would have made this two
  changes in one deploy and left neither cleanly attributable. Only `.py`
  delta vs the previously deployed `448e1816` is
  `memory_observability.py` + its tests.
- Expected: `MEMORY_GUARD_ABORT stage=pre_source_state_fingerprint` falls
  from ~300 per 5.4h to ~0 within 24h with `anon` flat (±25MB);
  `layer2_shortlist` `written_at` advances every ~65s instead of freezing;
  `#387`'s overview stops aborting at `sports_done=0 sports_total=8`.
- **Read `basis` BEFORE the abort count.** `basis=unreclaimable` proves the
  new path executed. `basis=reclaimable_cache` means it degraded to the old
  arithmetic and a zero abort count is inert-guard-shaped and means nothing.
  A zero is evidence only once the instrument is known able to read non-zero.
- Measured: `<pending>` — 24h read due **2026-08-14 ~13:00 CDT**.
  **OWNER ASSIGNED 2026-08-13 15:3x CDT: scheduled task `417-24h-read`**, a
  one-shot at 2026-08-14 13:00 CDT
  (`C:\Users\tempadmin\.claude\scheduled-tasks\417-24h-read\SKILL.md`). It
  carries the deploy boundary (`2026-08-13T18:05:38Z`), the service id, the
  verdict rule, and the three traps that caught this session (the ~35-second
  log-query window; `basis` being emitted only on the abort branch; and the
  positive-control requirement before believing any zero).
  - **Scheduled LOCALLY, not as a cloud routine, and that is load-bearing.**
    `.env` is gitignored (`.gitignore:3`) and untracked, so a cloud agent gets
    a checkout with no `RENDER_API_KEY` and cannot reach the Render API at all.
    It would have reported a null reading that looks exactly like a real one.
  - **Local tasks only run while the app is open.** If it is closed at 13:00
    the run happens at next launch — so a late timestamp on this row means
    "fired late", not "the worker was quiet". Check the run time before
    reading the numbers.
  - This row still stays open until the numbers are actually written into it.
    An assigned owner is not a measurement.
- INTERIM (T+23min, 13:28 CDT). **Positive, NOT sufficient. Row stays open.**
  - `LAYER2_SHORTLIST` x3 post-deploy — 18:19:15, 18:25:21, 18:28:30Z —
    against **0** in the 4h12m before. `MEMORY_GUARD_ABORT` post-deploy: 0,
    against ~300 in 5.4h before. The board is rebuilding.
  - Steady state at T+23min: `unreclaimable` ~1902-1916MB -> ~2180-2194MB
    available against the 1900 floor. Margin ~280MB.
  - **Why this is not yet proof.** The container is 23 minutes from boot.
    `#417` recorded that the pre-fix code ALSO rebuilt after a restart
    (14:56 restart -> 15:08 build) and then re-froze roughly 3h later as it
    re-warmed — it was aborting again by 18:00. This deploy has not yet
    survived that re-warm interval, so the observation is still consistent
    with "rebooted" as well as with "fixed".
  - At the 18:22:25Z transient spike (`current` 4042.6, `unreclaimable`
    3100.1) the NEW formula would itself have refused (996MB available).
    No abort fired because the guard is evaluated per cycle, not
    continuously — the spike is intra-build. Recorded so a later reader does
    not mistake it for the guard failing to fire when it should.
  - Instrument caveat: a 100-line log query on this service spans **~35
    seconds**. Any "n samples above X" count from a single query is a
    statement about that window, not about the post-deploy period.
- Not verified, deliberately unclaimed: that the new code PATH executed.
  `basis` is emitted only inside the abort branch
  (`intelligence_state.py:3215`), so a working fix leaves it permanently
  silent. Its absence here is a fact about the emitter. Closing that gap
  needs a success-path log — a code change and a second deploy, deliberately
  not ridden along with this one.
- Rollback: redeploy `448e1816` on `srv-d91dpertqb8s73co8ls0` via
  `POST /v1/services/<id>/deploys {"commitId":"448e1816"}`. Code-only, no
  `render.yaml` in this deploy, so nothing to unwind on the config side.

### PENDING

- [ ] Internal-hostname cutover — expected effect, window, and rollback
      to be written by `/preflight` **before** it goes out.
      NOTE 2026-08-13: `state.md` and `lanes.md` both record this as CLOSED
      and verified in production (`PUBLISH_OK ... url=http://syndicate-an21`
      at `14:54:11Z`). This file is append-only, so it needs a **new row**
      appended by its owner rather than an edit here — read on its own,
      the deploy ledger currently understates what is already known.
- [ ] `#395` rate ceiling — still `Measured: <pending>` with no follow-up row.
