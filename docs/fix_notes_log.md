# Fix Notes Log

## 2026-07-01 - Render health checks and stale deploy parity
- Symptom: Render kept restarting or timing out on `/healthz`, and live pages appeared stale even after pushes.
- Root cause: `/healthz` was doing deploy metadata work that was too expensive for Render's 5-second probe window, and `/versionz` was the correct place for detailed parity checks.
- Fix: Keep `/healthz` as a constant lightweight OK response and reserve `/versionz` for detailed commit/branch/runtime metadata.
- Validation: Focused health route tests passed and a local smoke test returned `/healthz` in milliseconds.
- Follow-up: Use this note pattern for future fixes so we record the symptom, the actual root cause, and the verification path in one place.
